1,ChIJ08g_akxYzpQR0RO2V9l10wA,5,3 months ago,"Superb coffee shop in S√£o Paulo, easily one of the best. Their house roasts are few, but expertly selected and cover almost all the possible requirements for a cup of coffee. Their espresso is well taken, resulting in a cup that is far more complex than a standard bitter cup.
Their sandwiches, cakes and pastries are all delightful, nothing to add.
The house is clearly a safe haven for the progressive and leftwing, and all the patrons and staff are so polite and nice to each other.
The only point I""d suggest is to lower the volume of the music a bit, it was somewhat hard to maintain a conversation.",0.2572916666666666,Positivo

Other great thing about this place is the vibes. The servers were very kind, open and welcoming. Great environment to relax and feel welcome with your drink ‚ò∫Ô∏è

47,ChIJMx_GCb1XzpQR0HcKUeEoCxk,4,4 years ago,"Quality coffee and nice atmosphere.

Overall, the quality here is very nice. We ordered a variety of items to try and all were very good. Only item that we truly did not enjoy was the espresso and panna. Espresso was burnt and once that happens, even the sweetness of the panna can‚Äôt cover it. All other coffee drinks were good however. I ordered the biscoito, which was very good. The other dish, bread and butter, was so so honestly. I think ultimately it would‚Äôve been paired better with a different bread than brioche, which isn‚Äôt what you typically expect for a bread and butter.

Also love the way the place is decorated, and the outdoor space is very nice. Two thumbs up for that.

A few small downsides for me: the menu is a bit confusing. We didn‚Äôt really understand the first several options prior to getting to what appears to be the main menu. Overall, I think the menu could be clarified more, including food option descriptions (maybe pictures?).

Other small downside is they seat you, which is possibly in order to effectively fill their space. However, for me, it gives more of a restaurant feel, rather than a casual, cozy caf√©. As far as this point goes, I don‚Äôt really take away from them, as I believe this is more of a personal preference when grabbing caf√©.

For the food I would not come back. I‚Äôve ordered a grilled fish with smashed potatoes. 40 reais. They didn‚Äôt have potatoes so they offered me a simple salad. I asked if it was possible to be rice instead of the salad and they agreed, 10 minutes later they came back and I was informed that all the other meals were pre Cooked but the fish. So they wouldn‚Äôt.

On the top of it all? You know the GRILLED fish? It came FRIED. When I already laughing asked about the grilled fish they looked me and doubting of my intelligence or even my sight said: ‚Äúit‚Äôs just really grilled‚Äù. You can see the meal on the photo.

It‚Äôs my fault. I insisted.

We ordered several things for our brunch and, quite simply, the best cheese bread (it was the cheese bread with cream cheese) I've ever eaten!!! We spent around R$115, prices are not abusive at all. The order did not take long to be served and everything was super fresh.
The decoration is impeccable in every detail: faucet, glasses, chairs, the feline reinterpretations of the canvases ü§©

Starting with the unjustified wait caused by the delay in releasing the tables, we waited half an hour when there were places available. At the exit there were more than 10 groups waiting while inside at least 5 tables were empty. I don't know if they do it on purpose so that people can take pictures, but maybe that's because at the entrance they asked people to wait outside in the cold so as not to disturb anyone who wanted to take pictures in the hallway.

The wait extends to the service, which, although it doesn't serve the tables (you have to ask at the cashier), takes a while. The coffees and two Cookies took half an hour too, which were diluted between one shot and another.

The cookies were tasty but nothing to justify the R$15 each. The chocolate had 2 fingers of Nutella in the bottom that if mixed with the sweet hot chocolate would be inedible.

At first, if you're used to cafeterias and stores where you enter or else there are tables to sit at, you might find it strange.. But you can get used to it!

Their intention is to be that place that sells 'Coffee to go', coffee to go, you pass by, order without any bureaucracy, simple menu and efficient ordering system, grab your coffee and continue your journey!

They have options for hot, cold and some sweet/salty drinks.

What I ordered:
üî∏Ô∏èPure Black (R$5.20)
- Double espresso
üî∏Ô∏èBlack Ginger (R$13.40)
- Espresso with ice, tonic and ginger

The Espresso I found quite bitter, it wasn't to my liking, but I really liked the Black Ginger! It is pretty much love it or hate it as some may not like the tonic and ginger..

Anyone looking for a coffee shop is looking for something different. Nespresso many people drink at home or in the office.
There isn't even strained as an option. For those who understand extraction methods, you know that a carioca (which was offered) is different from a strained one in V60 or Chemex. The coffee strained in these methods I mentioned is cleaner, soft drink and with much more sweetness.

Well... I ended up ordering an Egg Maltine Frappuccino, a Belgian chocolate pie and a still water.
In this matter the service sinned. It looked like Casas Bahia, delivering orders all in installments. First the pie arrived, after about 5 min the water arrived and after 10 min the Frappuccino.

Now about the orders: (contains irony) the water was fantastic, mineral, cold and with ice and lemon in the glass. The pie, I thought it was a little sweet and firm, the presentation is pretty. And finally the Frappuccino.......ah the Frappuccino. Seriously.... I was outraged! R$16.00 for practically just whipped cream. I discarded 90% of what was handed to me. The amount of liquid was ridiculous, it seems that they extracted a standard 40ml espresso, put a little milk and the rest pure whipped cream. Just see the photos I'm posting. I removed 'almost all' whipped cream, because there was still a little leftover that sank into the glass. But you can see with the glass still full the amount of drink.

Total of R$46.00. There's a lot to improve!",0.0344047619047618,Positivo

It is a Maid Caf√©, a subcategory of cosplay caf√©s that appeared in Japan in 2001.

In a playful and delicate environment, where pastel colors predominate, the customer is received by attendants dressed as servants from the Victorian era who address him as 'master'. They say that they are actually kittens, and that only by magic that lasts for the time they stay in the establishment (1 hour), communication with humans is possible.

On the menu, predominate colored milk shakes, cakes, pies, coffees, teas. I had the red velvet cake (hmmmm‚Ä¶) with coffee. All very tasty.

When you order the food, you also order the kind of treatment you want to receive. I ordered the funny/clunky one. I don't know if I was supposed to get into the role and scold the girl every time she messed up, but I couldn't. She apologized and I said 'it's okay, honey, everything's great' lol

In the end, I left feeling that it was a bit of a fetishized place. I, who have no inclination to boss others around or be bossed around, felt a little uncomfortable.",0.30375,Positivo

I visited on Saturday at 1:00 pm, an empty time where I stayed until 3:30 pm, and when I left there was already a considerable queue.
To visit the Jardim dos Gatos you need to book in advance, the times are every 30 minutes with a limit on the number of visitors at a time, and honestly I think it's worth paying (R$16.90), where part of the money goes to NGO maintain the costs, it is a beautiful space, the cats are well taken care of and most of the time playful, and it has toys for you to interact with them.
Even though I'm not vegan, I thought it would have more vegan options on the menu, but since it opened recently, I hope to have more options in the future.
The cat garden is totally separate from the restaurant area, the places are totally clean and don't share the same environment.

What we ask:
*Italian cappuccino (R$12.20) - it's a good option for those who like classic drinks, even more so with a cat design on top that makes it a pity to drink.
*Creamy Italian chocolate (R$14.90) - in my opinion it was the best decision, it is a very creamy drink with an incredible flavor, you can tell that the chocolate is of good quality.
*Pink lemonade (R$14.90) - I didn't particularly like it, the drink is very acidic and doesn't go well with food.

*Quiches with Salad + tomato and basil (R$26.50) - I highly recommend it, the quiche is wonderful and the salad is very well served.
*Las 3 Marias (R$33.90) - A well-balanced meal, easy to please anyone.

I ordered a hot chocolate that was very delicious and a portion of 3 mini vegan drumsticks, which left something to be desired. The dough didn't seem to have any seasoning, very dry and with a taste of flour, the filling was even good but I wouldn't eat it again, I've tried other coxinhas de jackfruit much better. The peanut butter and jelly toast was good, but not memorable. Perhaps they need to improve the food part of the menu, or focus only on coffee, since food is not their strong point.

Very nice decoration of the place, but due to the prohibitions it ends up not being a cozy place.

About the menu:
Plenty of options for both breakfast and lunch.
The hours leave something to be desired, they serve lunch until 4pm and coffee from 4pm to 7pm and on Sundays they only have the lunch option. From what I understand, they made an exception in serving us coffee (as long as it was the simplest) and a crepe.
The crepe is very tasty, thin crust and just the right amount of filling. I was a little upset as I removed a piece of HAIR from my plate. I took it out quickly and threw it on the floor, I didn't approach any of the employees, I looked at the rest of the crepe to see if there was anything left and I continued eating. But I didn't feel confident anymore and it kind of 'failed the ride'.
The coffee was served in the cup with splashes (apparently from the machine itself, ok), but in general in other places this is not usually the case.

It would be a more cozy place if the customer had the option of freely choosing the menu, regardless of the time of day.

I found it strange and bizarre not to be able to take pictures in the place, but we respected it and inside we only photographed the dishes, which was very frustrating!
The waiter was very respectful when approaching asking us not to take pictures because they were sale items (I even asked if the place was about to close, which would make sense to sell the decor, but he said no).

We decided to leave the place, without tasting everything we had intended, since we understand that coffee on Sundays was an exception. To mark the moment and the visit, we decided to take pictures on the public sidewalk, taking advantage of the beauty of the front of the store.
A kind young man even closed the door for the photos to be more beautiful, although we were not comfortable being on the street.
A lady, maybe the same one mentioned in the comments that I hadn't read before going to the place, opened the door and made comments about being able to take pictures and not book, but as we are not doing any book, much less carrying photographic equipment I just I smiled and continued shooting.

I don't intend to return to the place because I don't feel welcomed and because the hours are 'strange' and incompatible with my routines.
But it would have everything to be a nice place to go.
A feather!

Obs. I had given 2 stars because the CREPE WITH dark hair (since my daughter and I are redheads) was tasty. However, after reading the distortions of information from the 'responsible', I thought it prudent to reduce to ZERO stars, too bad we only have the option of 1.",0.1248910840932117,Positivo

The owner there was clueless, treated me in a way that no customer treats, completely disrespectful.
I went once and came back the second time, I mentioned it to my sister, niece, aunt and friends, I had done the best word of mouth, but I withdraw everything positive I said and have already warned the people I know, it doesn't matter if the place is beautiful and you are mistreated! I made a comment on Instagram and got blocked. LOL.
I wasn't going to comment anything here on Google, but I saw that many people spoke about the lack of tact of the Owner of the place.
And that!

In response to what you comment in your answer below:
I was disappointed with what happened and I'm not ashamed to say what happened, truthfully.
I went into the Bistro, upset, I wasn't having a good day, I had left the house with nothing to wear, I was returning from the doctor and I just wanted to go into a nice place, order a coffee and work.
I asked to use the bathroom and internet, the waiter pointed me to the bathroom and said they didn't have internet. I used the bathroom and unfortunately I had an intestinal disorder, but I took all the precautions, I put the toilet paper face down, (inside the wastebasket), I flushed and made sure that the toilet was clean, I looked in the bathroom for a disinfectant or a little sniff to soften the odor (there wasn't any) and I went to wash my hands (I still thought I'm going to throw liquid soap in the toilet, but I didn't have any), I went to the men's bathroom and washed my hands. I sat down at the table (a little embarrassed) ordered a coffee and a croissant, but I couldn't take too long, because I was working and what wasn't my surprise when the owner of the place asked to sit next to me and told me more or less like this: 'you must use the bathroom and flush it quickly, you left a horrible smell in the bathroom, the lady who cleans it is not here today and I had to clean it, I put all my lunch outside, I had to use a lot of disinfectant to the smell goes away, imagine if there were people near the door, you shouldn't even use the subway bathroom like that and......a few other things'
I was horrified and still felt guilty for not being well. I paid my bill and said, the place is beautiful, but I won't come back here anymore, I thought it was a lack of respect and sensitivity in how you treated me.
You need to have more empathy with others.

I was surprised by the space, Quanti Cafeh opened a little while ago, it is still finishing adjustments to the structure, even though it is already open. It's really cool to see the 'birth' of this company with a different 'footprint'. And the owners are present, solicitous and willing to resolve criticisms and accept suggestions.

It has the promise of being a 'sensory caf√©' and in fact everything contributes to a unique experience: ambient music with quiet MPB, cozy chairs, VAST amount of books to accompany your coffee and the option to sit on a sofa, either alone or to read a story to the children.

As for drinks, it has several experiences, hot, cold, drinks, based on espresso, milk, filtered, strained, etc. And BEAUTIFUL baristas!

The environment is also PET FRIENDLY and you can bring your dog!

Quanti Cafeh offers vegetarian and vegan meals and drinks, very well seasoned, perfect cooking, tasty and homemade food! They are prepared in an open kitchen, where it is possible to follow the preparation of the dishes and see a small garden of fresh spices on the counter, used in the dishes.

All organic waste is reused in composters that feed the vegetable gardens on the counter. Coffee grounds are also recycled through a partnership with Recoffee Design, which transforms them into durable products such as decorative objects and biojewelry (some of these products are for sale in a discreet shop next to the kitchen).

The most different drink I saw was an Ora Pro Nobis Lager, but it has several drink options, including natural ones.

The dishes are √† la carte, the lunch option is unique (a main course option that comes with the salad of the day) and does not follow a defined menu (they are still studying one), so get ready to be surprised by the dish of the day! Because they are always different dishes, values ‚Äã‚Äãmay vary depending on the ingredients of the day.

Today I had a vegetarian lasagna, with eggplant, zucchini, cheese and tomato. It came with two salads: coleslaw and hummus. Very good dish for one person. For dessert, I had a semisweet chocolate ganache tart with strawberry sauce. Everything on point and well seasoned. Finally came the cappuccino very well garnished in the latte (I chose the vegetable one) and very tasty.

The owners reported that they are still finalizing the adaptation for small children (the high chair arrives in a week, the changing table in the bathroom in a month), but the space already has a cozy sofa to stay with them.

The environment has comfortable tables and chairs of different capacities (couples, groups), sofa and also the counter.

No one has arrived yet according to another employee who answered.

I leave this comment so that other users do not go through this.

One suggestion would be to offer the customer a new menu item as an apology, so that he can enjoy something good in the midst of disappointment.

1131,ChIJmz3ITSn2zpQRxvOx13Gno-M,3,4 years ago,"a 2 stars review is as insulting as ‚Äòbonitinho por√©m ordin√°rio‚Äô.  let me elaborate better:
I love LPQ. it‚Äôs useless to think that all LPQ around the world can serve the same food: of course they are different: LPQ buenos aires serves unimpressive & nondescriptive  food. LPQ NY it‚Äôs very good, but not as good as LPQ washington, which is nevertheless just a shadow of the gorgeous LPQ le sablons in bruxelles. of course we are talking about bites & sweet treats, not haute cuisine; overpriced bites, a constant all over the world.
LPQ sao paulo began his history very badly with the pinheiros restaurant. then they opened in lots of shopping malls. the menu itself is interesting & offers the same good tartines they serve all over the world.  a very, very good salmon & avocado tartare. the sweet treats are less consistent but there‚Äôs a good pistachio tart. anyway the pastry in general is lackluster and sometimes not that fresh...
unfortunately, the shopping higienopolis restaurant is so shabby you could say it‚Äôs plainly run down. too bad becs it has a great garden. it‚Äôs a very charming old house which has a splendid little balcony on an internal patio, they do not open at all... the place is not that clean, the waiters lack basic training.
the worst: the food one day is good, the other is lame. they simply cannot keep the same standard of quality from one day to the other. it‚Äôs almost a roulette russe: you never know if the food is going to shoot or not... one day their hibiscus tea is great, the other is stale.  the mousse de chocolat can be so good you just cannot stop thinking when you can go back and have another one, then it becomes so tasteless & badly prepared you have to give it back to the waiter. coffee is an abomination: a matter of taste, but what is not subjective is that having coffee in a cup broken & dirty is plainly revolting.
the problem with this restaurant, since I‚Äôve been in other LPQ in SP with no problems whatsoever, is there is no effective menagement here, nor the employees are effectively trained.
when you‚Äôre having your food at 9:15 pm (the restaurant closes at 10:00 pm) & the cleaning staff is already sweeping the floor around you, the only thing you can do is finish quickly, so the cloud of dust does not enter your mouth, leave & have coffee & dessert in the nearby mall.

I had a meal for lunch and the dish was wonderful, poreeeemmm... when buying a pizza (at night), whose order was placed exactly at 9:00 pm, it was only ready at 10:30 pm, and because my husband was questioning me all the time , and worst of all, is that the pizza (MADE ON TIME) was cold, the cheese wasn't even melted!! We took it to the room due to tiredness and the delay in ordering, and we only gave it back because it would be a lot of work to go down, but it was the worst pizza I've ever eaten, cold, hard cheese, and no flavor. Even a pizza stale in the fridge tastes better. Other than that we ordered a juice that wasn't even delivered on time. So if the restaurant is full, it's better to buy the frozen pizza from the convenience store (which they heat up there) than to buy a meal. Not worth it.

I was with my wife, my triplets and my parents when we sat at a table in this creperie to order a crepe when my babies started crying wanting their bottles. I asked one of the attendants to pour some water into the creperie sink because the bottle had excess water. One of the attendants, the 'superior attendant', stated that she could not answer my request because it was only for use in the Shopping Mall! I was at the creperie inside the Shopping kkk' I felt like an indigent. Without understanding the posture of this attendant I replied, thank you! Then the same attendant was staring at me with a mocking look, expressing anger. I was very embarrassed and angry because no one is treated like that. I saw a comment here on Google reviews by a customer that said the following about the aforementioned Creperie: they were very attentive to me and my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwho was thirsty and they gave him a disposable glass of water, I thought it was simply AMAZING'
And with my 11-month-old children who were crying because they wanted to drink milk from a bottle??????????? I love animals, but children come first, don't they? I, as a Tutelary Counselor, see rape of the vulnerable, abandonment of the incapable, beatings, etc., and treating my children like this is unacceptable! Does this attendant have children? Is this attendant a good mother? Does she, as part of a society, value defending the rights of children and adolescents as stated in Law 8069, ART 4? Sad to be treated by such a person! In the end, my wife bought a sweet crepe but I lost my will because of this employee's neglect! Lack of empathy, lack of humanity, lack of professionalism! What world is this?

Don't do something like that.

This guy lacks management or training!
Today, January 9th, I had a bad experience at Kopenhagen do Village.
I could never imagine that there, in that mall, I would find such a mocking, ironic and responsive employee!
I asked if there wasn't a manager and he went to call him himself, something I doubt he did or if he did, his absence, the store is sorely missed!
We left without speaking to the manager, who didn't come down.
The boy, without patience, threw the cat's tongue and left without even putting it in a bag, such was the employee's slight!
Of all the Kopenhagens I've been to, this was the first time I received this kind of treatment!

I had to flag one star in order to comment, but the correct rating would be ""minus star"".
When we arrived, today, at the place and went to a recently vacated table, with 4 chairs (the table seats 4), a gentleman - who later we would come to know is Luiz, the owner - abruptly and even rudely , crossed in front of us, without even asking us how many we were in, and removed one of the chairs, taking it to a table at the side. As we were waiting for my husband, my son went to another table, with an unoccupied chair, and asked if it could be given to us, to which they cordially replied yes. When my son removed the chair, Luiz intervened and asked: 'but how many are you in?' With my son's answer, that there were 3 of us, Luiz said out loud: 'here we don't have a chair for a bag!' My husband arrived, and I said that we would leave, as I would not have breakfast in that place. By the way, I won't go back to that Frans Caf√© unit even if it's the last place on earth to have a coffee. I have never witnessed such rude treatment in a trade. And the owner! I repeat: the table seats four and he had removed one of the chairs without asking us. Therefore, if there was a chair left at the next table, it didn't matter if it was occupied by a purse. It is obvious that if a chair was missing or if someone arrived and needed a seat, it would be readily offered. There was no justification for being rude to me and my son, out loud and in front of everyone. Before leaving the place, I went to the cashier and asked the name of the gentleman, and at first glance I was ignored by the woman who was there, but when asked again, she replied: 'it's Luiz and he's my husband'. I said: 'He is a terrible customer service person!' Luiz, who had disappeared through the door, came back and told me: 'you must be stressed for another reason'. No, Luiz, I wasn't stressed. I'm on vacation in S√£o Paulo, and when I come to the capital - and I come to S√£o Paulo a lot - I always go to Ofner, at Shopping Ibirapuera, where I've always been very well attended and where everything is divine, from the environment to the products, excellence, even the attendants.

Your service system is horrible
After paying at the cashier, where there is an organized queue, there is a fight to get what you bought.
It's every man for himself. Those who don't play or speak loudly are not answered or stay last. This stresses the employee and especially the customer who leaves with a bad experience

I know that Padoca is the more casual of the three restaurants with more accessable pricing and dining experience, but at the very least I would think the dishes would be well seasoned and delicious. We ordered the mini polvilho with the house made coalhada (sour cream). The alternative choice was an industrialized requeij√£o, a surprise they would even serve an industrialized cheese like that, but their sour cream was very good. We also had the Rosbife de filet mignon which came with a warm potato salad and lettuce with what was supposed to be a dijon dressing. The filet mignon was dry and chewy. The potato salad was better the next day, we brought the leftovers home and added sea salt and butter which brought out the flavor of the herbs. We did ask for salt at the restaurant but they only had iodized table salt in little paper packets. The soup of the day was pretty good. It was a creamy potato leek soup with their house bread. Tasted like it had homemade chicken broth and the bread seemed to be naturally fermented and was covered in seeds. We brought home a slice of gluten-free chocolate hazelnut cake that was moist and surprisingly good after the meal we had.
The service was good, and the space is cute and on trend, although it""s a very small space inside and even though there""s a lot of interesting added value products to buy like the Man√≠ olive oil and some good looking coffees and ghee, we couldn""t even shop because all the products are on shelves in the hallway entrance and standing there to look at products blocks the flow of people entering and exiting the restaurant.

Pros:
+Simple environment with little decoration where you place your order on a tablet with a very simple and intuitive interface on the sidewalk.
+I went on a holiday eve after dinner, I didn't face a queue, it was a very quick and smooth process.
+There are few drinks, but the ones they have are very tasty, I particularly loved the house matcha Latte.
+The service is fast.

Neutral:
-The place has a very simple proposal, so there is very little space for you to support your order or even sit down, the most likely thing is that you have a drink or eat standing up right on the sidewalk, especially if the place is full.
-Although the service is fast, it owes a little in terms of friendliness, but nothing that becomes a problem.
-Considering the region, the price is quite 'okay'.

Cons:
-Unluckily or not, the app itself on the tablet owed a little, nothing too serious to the point of delaying too much, but it was a little slow and even crashed, needing to reopen it.
-Croassans, cookies, etc... They are not reheated, they come at the temperature that is there in the window.

Would I go back again? If I worked in the region, I would definitely go there twice a month to have something, everything I tried was very tasty, but as I don't work in the region, the answer is 'very unlikely'.

Final considerations: Although I have raised a lot of cons and neutral points, the place fulfills its proposal well, which is to be a 'coffee station', it has its flaws, but they did not become an absurd problem for me, apart from the fact that the drinks are pretty fancy.",0.0402002728174603,Positivo

They also offer other various breakfast combinations to satisfy you depending on your level of hunger, which are delicious and very affordable as well. The other great things about this place is their coffee offerings - plenty of creations all served with a nice presentation.

Additionally, they have a very nice lunch offering and the bakery has fresh bread and treats everyday (the carrot cake with the chocolate is a personal favorite).

I now go once a month or so to enjoy a nice breakfast outside on their open patio - a lovely spot to start your Saturday or Sunday.

+I had the pleasure of trying some cakes there, some are 'good' others are great. For example, the brigadeiro cake is well stuffed, not too sweet, very moist, I liked it a lot, curiously I found it quite nostalgic and extremely tasty, mainly because of the filling that reminds me a little of my grandmother's chocolate cake, while the chocolate cake white chocolate with strawberry was much sweeter, with a more intense sweetness, which I confess I didn't like as much as the brigadeiro, but my wife loved it.

The chef sent out an amuse-bouche, a bolinho de bacalhau (codfish ball), just a bite but quite good coming from this connoisseur of bolinhos de bacalhau. They also provided a couvert of delicious warm fresh baked breads with various spreads. I chose the ceviche of the day as my appetizer. The portion was very generous, almost big enough for an entr√©e. My entr√©e was the house specialty: octopus (polvo) cooked in a special oven called a ‚ÄúJosper‚Äù. This oven both cooks the selected item, be it seafood or meat, and finishes it off with a barbecue type exterior. This dish was extraordinary and, at my request, the chef very kindly agreed to show me the Josper oven.

I have visited a long list of Michelin star restaurants and I am quite familiar with the standards required to gain and maintain stars. I believe if a Michelin guide critic experienced my visit the star would have been put into question. I will start with the negative.

The music is very questionable, the interior decor gives a warm and cosy ambience but they were playing heavy rock and other loud, heavy beat tracks which ruined the ambience and left me very unsettled as a diner and I found it difficult to focus on the conversation. On top of that the speaker behind us had a poor connection so it was producing a distressing interference/ high pitch sounds. We raised this with the waiter and asked if they could turn it down or disconnect the speaker but they did not despite multiple reminders, they could have moved our seat when the restaurant was emptier but they did not.

We asked for non-alcoholic cocktails at the entrance as we saw some really creative cocktail options. The waiter questioned us in shock, ‚Äúno alcohol?‚Äù and proceeded to question us at to our reasons, this was quite alarming and unprofessional. When we were seated upstairs we saw other drinks arriving, we had to remind them of our drinks order which was 2 different drinks of their creation, when the drink eventually arrived it was 2 of the same drink and not different drinks. We were essentially served straight juice with a bit of lemon. Despite asking for no ice, the drink returned with ice twice and the third time a diluted version where the ice had clearly just been removed and the drink not remade.

There were repeated instances of poor attention to detail and a general lack of attentiveness from the staff. Multiple of the tasting menu courses arrived without the adequate cutlery already placed. Multiple requests for ignored such as requests for salt and pepper, which arrived almost halfway through the meal despite asking at the start and multiple reminders being given. Requests for bread were also late. The food was churned out quickly but the rest of the service was very slow and poor.

The food was generally good. The tuna served on ciabatta was delicious, as was the black cod. Whilst the food was consistently well presented the flavours did not always live up to the presentation or the Michelin standard one would expect. For example, the lamb chop was seasoned to perfection but there was no meat on the chop and the little meat present was extremely chewy and gristly. I mentioned it to the waiter who brought another and it was delicious, tender and succulent; this should have been served in the first place.

The sourdough bread is freshly made in the restaurant. The desserts were also good. They give you a goodie bag on the way out which contains cookies.

I ordered the classic which consisted of filet mignon and angel hair pasta in a sauce that I don't think I've tasted before, but it was very rich and complimented the meat and pasta very well. The steak was cooked to perfection, although interestingly I wasn't asked how I'd like it to be done so this could be a problem if you like your steak done in a very specific way.

Being that it""s Sunday and the restaurant is near Ave Paulista, there were droves of people in the mall it is located in as well as the restaurant being packed.

He got the order correct even with the language barrier, and we were eating within 30 minutes. Sadly, I felt the food was not up to my standards as most chain restaurants tend to be, and the price was a little high. It was incredibly loud in a packed restaurant open to the mall on one side. I did learn something curious while I was there. For years, I used  TripAdvisor as a restaurant guide as its review structure and rating system were accurate to real life. This, however, has changed due to an interesting practice I observed in the restaurant. Ricardo brought me a tablet open to TripAdvisor and asked me to rate and review the restaurant along with the bill. I noticed that this location was rated the second best restaurant in Sao paulo out of 14000. I am her to tell you this restaurant is not in the top 500 nevemind the top ten.

All for a fair price, with spectacular service and a family atmosphere (if possible, try to go on weekdays, for dinner, when the mall is less crowded). In short, value for money is worth it!

For starters, the pastries (extremely crunchy, sun-dried meat and coalho cheese with cream cheese) are very tasty and worth ordering. Also noteworthy are the poop lemonades with passion fruit and berry. As a main course, the Siciliano (present on the Due menu) is very tasty, both for the good breaded shrimp, the main stars of the dish, and for the brie, apricot, leek and almond risotto. For vegetarians, Quinoa Primavera was also highly approved.

Finally, the desserts deserve a paragraph just for them, after all they were sensational. And here's a tip. Ask for the typical sweets. The bolo de rolo, heritage of Pernambuco, the state where the Camarada Camar√£o chain was born, is one of the best I've ever tasted. Balanced, with the perfect layers and unique flavor.

They don't pass your table proactively. You will always have to call them.

Food wasn""t great, especially for the price. My wifes seared tuna was still fridge cold in the middle. Some of my grilled veggies had been cremated. Everything was under seasoned.

While the servers were pleasant, they lacked a basic concept of service; constantly leaning over us, not acknowledging our requests (how are we meant to know if you heard us?), not replacing the cutlery we ate our seafood starter with, to eat my steak main (even when we asked)  Slamming my beer down on the table, and not making a substitution when the restaurant had ran out of an element of a dish (salad isn""t the same as fries. If they ran out of the ""special"" fries for the steak tartare then they ought to switch them for one of the many other types of fries they sell, instead of making me purchase a whole portion additionally)

When I told the waitress I""d like to remove the service charge she abrasively asked me why. I told her that I wasn""t happy with the service and expected better, she put my receipt on the table without saying a word (no thank you or goodbye, let alone an apology) and walked off.

The macarons are in the window, with their respective flavor names.
And the flavors‚Ä¶they are incredible!
It's surprising how they manage to bring an incomparable flavor to the sweet and everything is very balanced.
For example, I bought a caramelized banana üçå macaron. I felt the taste of banana and her caramelized. I thought it was great how they managed to bring 2 flavors in a single candy!

In the store üè¨ you can buy gift boxes.

Macarons cost 6.50 each.

There is a very large variety of flavors üòã.

Terrible! I paid dearly for all of this, I didn't receive the right products I paid for and they still got a crepe for them, and the ones I took home were in conditions impossible to eat. Congratulations to those involved! Worst place I have the misfortune to visit and I will never go back!

These people are outstanding!
We came here the first time soon after we saw it opening. They have a tatami area and a normal seating area (do I need to say where my daughter wants to dine???)
It was also our last restaurant before going in quarantine... And our last few delicious caipirinhas.
Yesterday we ordered take-away out of 'saudades' and we were happy like a child on Christmas Eve! We found some nice personal touches in our bag.
Their service has always been personal and outstanding, and in times they need to differentiate even more, they sure know how to live up to the new expectations!
How lucky to have such a pearl just behind our street corner.

Ficamos muito animados quando vimos o restaurante abrindo na esquina e fomos unos dos primeiros a jantar l√° no tatami. Mais tarde tamb√©m foi nossa √∫ltima noite antes de entrar em quarentena. Ontem de 'saudades' pedimos entrega e ficamos felizes como no dia de natal!!!  A equipe sempre foi incrivelmente amig√°vel, e encontramos algumas coisas extras na nossa bolsa.

3196,ChIJEcsFHuxbzpQRRsQLe-GPDu0,5,4 months ago,"I booked the restaurant through the Fork, there was a promotion of 30% and I wrote that I wanted a table in the tatami section. We arrived on time and were greeted at the door, but our table was just a normal table in the middle of the restaurant, so, they don""t read their reservations. I saw there was a tatami table free but thought it should be reserved before us, but no: A couple entered after us, asked for that table and seated there. thanks. They didn""t even ask were we wanted to sit! The place we sat in was very dark and I noticed that half the lights in the restaurant were off. (???) Trying to save energy ?! It would be romantic if there were some candles but no. The staff was nice, the watermelon juice was incredible, but the mojito was horrible. We asked for the premium rod√≠zio and sushi came. It was very nice, the fish was fresh, but the not very creative for something that is premium I don""t think it was as expected... Sorry, had much better, you should really try to be more creative. The 'best' were the ones with truffle oil, duck magret, quail egg and scallop, like trying to be very chic but the inspiration is just french restaurant? And they even brought us more of the truffle and quail egg almost raw without us asking (I hate truffle and my boyfriend hates raw egg, ) I was like, okayyy... Could have told us before making it? It was an extra from the chef but I just wanted some sashimi so they brought slices as big as beef, one finger thick, one finger wide, could not fit my mouth... God, we were waiting for them to see we didn""t want any more and just take the rest away... And that""s when we were ignored for half an hour and they started to close the restaurant. We called the one that was close, which I think was the manager, and asked if we could have the rest of the degustation, we wanted the hot dishes. He asked us what was missing and was surprised we had nothing hot yet. He was very nice, told us it would take a minute and very fast we had the shimeji and seafood hot dishes... It was reheated sorry I noticed that...  It was not crisp and succulent like it should be, it was like dried rubber. The shimeji were not shimeji either, looked like small oyster mushrooms. The taste was good, but obviously was not made for us. Then it was half past eight and they had everything closed and the other clients were gone ( not forgotten, just us maybe) so we asked for the bill and asked if we had everything that was in the menu but the waiter told us... 'Aaahhh... You had the best ones.' I was horrified. We paid and run away from there... The staff was very nice but the service was one of the worst I have ever had. God, I swear, if you live or travel here in S√£o Paulo, don""t expect to be very well treated as a client in almost all commercial facilities in this city! And be very careful all the time. I was almost crying it was our two year anniversary and it was supposed to be special. Well, now I can write a informative review for you. I really hate to be mistreated in restaurants because I am a cook, so I am extra critic, if you want good sushi just go there, but don""t let them forget you! Be noisy!",0.0818224785966721,Positivo

I thought it was delicious, so I asked the girl at the cashier (a white and skinny girl) if there was any sauce in the sandwich and she sharply and without paying me much attention said no üòï. I found the way she spoke strange, since she didn't even ask me which sauce. But that's okay, what can you do? Again I asked her if any sauce was put on the sandwich and she said no. So I asked: to eat some of the sauce do I have to eat it here? She said yes. So I said: I'll eat here then. But my husband said that we had to take the sandwich, as our little dog was feeling sick in the car. So I went to the girl at the cashier and said that I couldn't eat there and I asked her if after they made my sandwich I could open the package and put a little bit of the sauce and she sternly told me: no. He didn't even look at me. My God, I couldn't believe this treatment of me. The sandwich I ordered cost 33.00 reais, which was a little sauce? The cashier girl could even have said no, but without harshness. Meanwhile, some people in the place were eating a sandwich, putting almost a whole thing in the sauce. It didn't cost anything to be kind. Anyway, I believe that the girl who served me was not the owner of the establishment, because I believe that the owner of the establishment would not do such rudeness. It didn't make sense to me that I couldn't open my sandwich wrapper and put some of the sauce on it. Did the lady think I was going to dump the whole thing on the sandwich? Or did she want to sell me some drippings of sauce? Anyway, I didn't buy the sandwich, because I wanted to put some sauce on it and the girl at the cashier said I couldn't ü§î. Since I wasn't going to get into a fight with her, I left. But I'm making this complaint because I think that good service and education is the differential in a company that values ‚Äã‚Äãits customers. Maybe I'm just one, but from grain to grain...",0.0658978174603174,Positivo

However, I also have to mention the fact that not giving 5 stars would be the hefty price. As much as the prices of things are all inflated, I believe that the value of the Kilo could be a little more into account, considering and comparing with other restaurants in the region and considering the place where the restaurant is located.
Only downside is the price which could be adjusted.

In my opinion it is one of the best value for money restaurants in the region. As it is an upscale neighborhood, many restaurants are quite expensive, but the prices here are consistent with the dishes in other regions (comparison made with a restaurant in the interior shopping center - O Tropeiro in the Bebedouro shopping center).

The dish I ordered was the commercial chicken fillet and a lot of food came. I ate in peace (I was well satisfied). For those who don't eat much, this dish easily serves 2 people. The food is extremely tasty.

It's a great place to go during the service's lunch hour (they don't take long to serve the dish), go with friends, for happy hour or a casual lunch.

We ordered the vegetarian dish of mandioquinha puree, mushrooms and salad with figs and arugula, it was delicious. And the rib dish with kale and corn meal, the rib melts in your mouth, perfect seasoning. I also ordered a berry lemonade juice. Overall the dishes are innovative and delicious.

The Paulist√¢nia lager draft beer is very good. Just don't argue with them about the ""couscous"" that is the mainstay of another dish. It is an angu (creamy polenta) well seasoned and very tasty, but it is not couscous. They say it is, but that's ok, what matters is that Saracura is here to stay.

There are 4 seats at the counter that overlook the kitchen directly; Makoto-san and his son prepared our omakase in front of us. The menu ended up being 15-16 portions for just under $800 BRL with a couple teas for two people. The flavours were perfectly balanced and it was such a delightful journey. Fresh ingredients carefully sourced. Lots of delicate flavours and happy use of citrus.,0.315,Positivo

We went to see the space and I loved everything, the decoration, the service, the space, the food, the drinks, the dessert all very incredible.
The space is not that big, but it is extremely cozy. The space between the tables allows you to have privacy, and you can move around smoothly. If you have any kind of mobility restriction, you can rest assured that the space will accommodate you.
Let's get to the dishes, how delicious, what a presentation, what a flavor, what a whim, what care. You can see that the boss does everything with a lot of love. We opted for the chef's recommendation, and it was an excellent choice. The dishes are extremely tasty, just right. There were other amazing options on the menu. Dessert is an explosion of flavors.

We went to meet and tasted some Portuguese delicacies such as alheira (which I love), codfish cake, dishes with cod pieces and also with it in chips or shredded. All simply sensational. Desserts are also part of the menu, such as the Bel√©m and Santa Clara pastries, as well as the Piriquita pillow.

üëâüèª The atmosphere is delicious and the service is great. And to make it even better, they have a super novelty for the Cup: in addition to the games being broadcast on the bistro's TVs, the customer will still have options for several portions and snacks from pubs and the Original beer will be sold for 13 reais! Simply unmissable!

Positive notes:  Prices are lower than market average, biscuits and gravy have a homemade taste, their bacon is VERY GOOD. I think I know where it's sourced from, and this stuff is thick, good marbling in it's fat (yes, bacon), and good natural flavor. Country fried steak is average. All menu items are cooked to order. The kitchen is open to guests for a more homey feel.  Owner's are very friendly and take time to make conversations with new and regular guests.

Neutral notes:  This is a Christian restaurant. They are open about their religious values but do not come across as pushy or force any sort of agenda or fellowship on you.  I enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant, and I do not have religious leanings. I have seen multiple regulars sit together at the same table adding to a very communal feeling.

Areas of Opportunity notes: Service is not super fast. It's a small place, but more tes than not, the person taking your order is also likely to be your cook, runner, server, busses, and cashier.  I don't recommend coming if you are in a hurry. Soft drink service is inconsistent. I have eaten here about six times and soda has been flat and crisp. I suspect they're using a soda system connected to smaller CO2 tanks.

Overall, I think this is a great hidden gem. Food quality is stronger than Blueberry Hill or Pancake Cabana. Service is not quick, and it feels like a small operation. However, prices are good, environment is very friendly, and they genuinely aim to make you feel at home.",0.15628367003367,Positivo

It's sad... a place where before it was delicious and the service was great, my father used to say it was a little piece of Italy and it turned into that.

The place no longer holds that many people and it is very tight to walk or dance, being clear that there were more people than allowed. Not to mention the long queues to pay (and we left a little early, so I don't think we got the longest queue of the night). And as if it couldn't get any worse, they overcharged our order at the end of the night.",-0.1095068027210884,Negativo

4074,ChIJIQdQJatZzpQR4cZPIILajHs,5,4 years ago,"Update

Strengths

Adhesion of the wristbands facilitated the service (however, a friend who was older did not fit on his arm, he was dissatisfied);
Change in security personnel made the environment more pleasant and humane;
By a cashier in the outside lane it improved a lot;
The 3 tracks (funk, electronic and pop) improved in choosing which environment to stay;

Negative points

A very full house, they need to respect the capacity, as this greatly reduces the attendance, not counting the locomotion in the space that is not feasible;
They should ban the use of electronic cigarettes on the subway track due to the size of the environment, which is much smaller compared to the others (in my case it is difficult because of my asthma, depending on the essence it is impossible to enjoy the role);
Organizing queues to get in and out still need to improve.
The cashier outside could be open before 4am if it is full on the day;

Would it be too much to ask to ask for pixta subway on Friday too?

It‚Äôs an all you can eat pizza concept for a fixed price.

So for little more than 30 Real you choose from a huge variety ranging from salty pizza to sweet pizza. Yeah you got me right, Brazilians love sweet pizza, just as they love the salty one.

I got myself slices of pizza with all kinds of toppings ranging from different cheeses, calabrese to chicken, and then the sweet pizzas rolled in.

And there I got a slice of chocolate pizza, one with smarties, little M&M as they call it here, and those with sweet cream combination. What should I say more.

I had the pleasure of eating a pizza with my family and we all left satisfied!!!!

Wonderful house. Excelent reception. Fantastic Pizzas

I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates REAL pizza with the right ingredients.

Very tasty pizza, less waiting time than I expected, I will buy many more times, the stuffed edge is magnificent.

Did you know that the capital of S√£o Paulo is the second city that consumes the most pizza in the world, second only to New York? That's right! Brazil produces something around 1 million pizzas a day and more than half are consumed in S√£o Paulo alone.

For those who enjoy truly Neapolitan-style pizza, this is perhaps the best place in town to satisfy your appetite. Although in the early days the individual disks soon after being served began to rubber, this problem has been completely resolved.

Pizza was born much earlier because it is a derivative of flat bread prepared by the ancient Greeks and Egyptians and it was already a popular snack when the tomato arrived in Italy brought by the Spanish rulers of Naples, in the 16th century. Today it is prepared with a multitude of ingredients.
