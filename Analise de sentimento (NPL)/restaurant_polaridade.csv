Por um Punhado de D√≥lares,"Very chill and hipster, cool place! Came here on a Monday morning. Great vibes here. Got the latte, banana bread and a cookie and all were super good. Top! Kind and fast service.

Por um Punhado de D√≥lares,"Superb coffee shop in S√£o Paulo, easily one of the best. Their house roasts are few, but expertly selected and cover almost all the possible requirements for a cup of coffee. Their espresso is well taken, resulting in a cup that is far more complex than a standard bitter cup.
Their sandwiches, cakes and pastries are all delightful, nothing to add.
The house is clearly a safe haven for the progressive and leftwing, and all the patrons and staff are so polite and nice to each other.
The only point I""d suggest is to lower the volume of the music a bit, it was somewhat hard to maintain a conversation.",0.25729166666666664,5,ChIJ08g_akxYzpQR0RO2V9l10wA,1,Positivo,1

Por um Punhado de D√≥lares,"Super enjoyed this place! We came in passing while waiting for our dinner reservation, and it was absolutely perfect.

Very well made cappuccino, and so many other nice drink options! Alcohol or non-alcohol. My friend also got a calming tea - made with chamomile, passion fruit, honey and orange. Also delicious!

Other great thing about this place is the vibes. The servers were very kind, open and welcoming. Great environment to relax and feel welcome with your drink ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Hope to be able to return here someday!

My carrot cake with chocolate was amazing! A slice was big and the cake itself was surprisingly very moist and yummy! Not super sweet but just tasty !!! I could eat five more slicesü§£
My cappuccino came with a cute little dog art on itüòò very lovely to see it ! Just one thing to say..... On the button of the cup, there was still powder left, i needed to blend a bit. Nothing more.

Coffee Lab,"Quality coffee and nice atmosphere.

Overall, the quality here is very nice. We ordered a variety of items to try and all were very good. Only item that we truly did not enjoy was the espresso and panna. Espresso was burnt and once that happens, even the sweetness of the panna can‚Äôt cover it. All other coffee drinks were good however. I ordered the biscoito, which was very good. The other dish, bread and butter, was so so honestly. I think ultimately it would‚Äôve been paired better with a different bread than brioche, which isn‚Äôt what you typically expect for a bread and butter.

Also love the way the place is decorated, and the outdoor space is very nice. Two thumbs up for that.

A few small downsides for me: the menu is a bit confusing. We didn‚Äôt really understand the first several options prior to getting to what appears to be the main menu. Overall, I think the menu could be clarified more, including food option descriptions (maybe pictures?).

Other small downside is they seat you, which is possibly in order to effectively fill their space. However, for me, it gives more of a restaurant feel, rather than a casual, cozy caf√©. As far as this point goes, I don‚Äôt really take away from them, as I believe this is more of a personal preference when grabbing caf√©.

For those who don""t like crowded places, avoid them during rush hours because getting your order is a little bit of a mess, but the tables are upstairs, making a great division of surroundings in general. On the other hand, it makes it very difficult for people who have some kind of mobility deficiency, keep in mind that the bathrooms are also upstairs.

For the coffees it was ok but overpriced.

For the food I would not come back. I‚Äôve ordered a grilled fish with smashed potatoes. 40 reais. They didn‚Äôt have potatoes so they offered me a simple salad. I asked if it was possible to be rice instead of the salad and they agreed, 10 minutes later they came back and I was informed that all the other meals were pre Cooked but the fish. So they wouldn‚Äôt.

On the top of it all? You know the GRILLED fish? It came FRIED. When I already laughing asked about the grilled fish they looked me and doubting of my intelligence or even my sight said: ‚Äúit‚Äôs just really grilled‚Äù. You can see the meal on the photo.

It‚Äôs my fault. I insisted.

We got there because we really wanted to have a good coffee and when we saw that we may have coffee tasting, it was not even a doubt we are going to get this order.

For food I really enjoyed burger. It was exactly the one I like. Good combination of bun, meat and veggies. I""m not a big fan of fries tho, so telling you that I didn""t like them would be a bit unfair, yet I can see that they didn""t really have any taste.
Our waiter was very very friendly. He dropped first portion of fries on me, but it was more funny than a pity. He apologized many times. Not a big deal tho. What I just want to say, that staff is very very pleasant.

The funniest thing is that the aesthetic of the place is so futuristic, but orders are still delivered on the basis of employees shouting the customers' names, which breaks the vibe for everyone nearby.

My fianc√© and I visited the space on 07/15, close to lunch time.
The service is incredible, the girls are very friendly and attentive, they did not leave us unattended.
When we arrived, only 3 tables were occupied, so we took the opportunity to explore the entire space and take several pictures.
We ordered several things for our brunch and, quite simply, the best cheese bread (it was the cheese bread with cream cheese) I've ever eaten!!! We spent around R$115, prices are not abusive at all. The order did not take long to be served and everything was super fresh.
The decoration is impeccable in every detail: faucet, glasses, chairs, the feline reinterpretations of the canvases ü§©
All very charming.
The place for preparing coffee and drinks was exposed, without a counter in front, I think it is a little uncomfortable during the operation.
I thought the little window that opens onto the kitchen was cute, where the attendants take the order to take it to the table (2D details even on that).
I was really delighted with the space, from the facade to the bathroom.

Gato Gri√¥ Caf√© 2D,"It's even hard to say anything about Gato Gri√¥ Caf√©. The charm begins when you enter Travessa da Dona Paula, where the caf√© is located. You have the impression that you are in a village outside of S√£o Paulo and that enchanted me right from the start.
Upon entering the Caf√©, I felt like I was in a comic book, such cuteness. The service is EXTREMELY FRIENDLY and I realized that it was not my privilege. Note 1000!
The menu is very complete and has different options. I had a coxinha de jackfruit, very different with a crispy outside that was very good.
The highlight of the place is being instagrammable from the entrance, tables, armchairs, kitchen, cashier and even the Toilette.
It's that place to go back to again and again.

Gato Gri√¥ Caf√© 2D,"Gato Gri√¥ is a cafe with a space that is super instagrammable but lacks in almost everything else.

Starting with the unjustified wait caused by the delay in releasing the tables, we waited half an hour when there were places available. At the exit there were more than 10 groups waiting while inside at least 5 tables were empty. I don't know if they do it on purpose so that people can take pictures, but maybe that's because at the entrance they asked people to wait outside in the cold so as not to disturb anyone who wanted to take pictures in the hallway.

The wait extends to the service, which, although it doesn't serve the tables (you have to ask at the cashier), takes a while. The coffees and two Cookies took half an hour too, which were diluted between one shot and another.

The cookies were tasty but nothing to justify the R$15 each. The chocolate had 2 fingers of Nutella in the bottom that if mixed with the sweet hot chocolate would be inedible.

Anyway, one of those places that everyone will want to visit because it's beautiful but will never want to go back.

I‚Äôm not sure if they had the option for a variety of beans, but it seemed a bit lacking in that way, almost a bit gimmicky.

That was the service. The ambience is focused, intentional, and pure. The seating next to the expresso machine could be better, but the shared seating adjacent to the escalators is great and it""s where I choose to sit each time.

Now for the quality of the coffee itself.

The Coffee,"‚òï Sooo worth the experience! I loved the design with this simplistic concept, super agile and practical!

I found The Coffee on instagram and as I was in a hotel close by, I decided to stop by!

At first, if you're used to cafeterias and stores where you enter or else there are tables to sit at, you might find it strange.. But you can get used to it!

Their intention is to be that place that sells 'Coffee to go', coffee to go, you pass by, order without any bureaucracy, simple menu and efficient ordering system, grab your coffee and continue your journey!

They have options for hot, cold and some sweet/salty drinks.

What I ordered:
üî∏Ô∏èPure Black (R$5.20)
- Double espresso
üî∏Ô∏èBlack Ginger (R$13.40)
- Espresso with ice, tonic and ginger

The Espresso I found quite bitter, it wasn't to my liking, but I really liked the Black Ginger! It is pretty much love it or hate it as some may not like the tonic and ginger..

It's worth a try, I saw some drinks with chocolate that must be really good!

Cute, cozy place (although it drizzled and I had to change places because the retractable roof was broken). I asked for a multigrain bread on the plate, and the attendant had to go and check if they had it, on a Friday afternoon. The traditional levain came because the multigrao didn't have it (8.00). I ordered a scrambled egg with butter (12.00).. it was delicious, but I ran out of it in the first mouthful! Tiny portion..disappointing. But the worst thing was the Nespresso latte (12.00), badly brewed, with no foam at all, and some Nespressos, which I drink at home. If the place's proposition is sweet, then the name of the establishment needs to be revised. Besides, coffee, which comes before or after food, sucks!

Heaven Caff√®,"I already thought about going another time, but I gave up because I saw that the coffees were all Nespresso. But today (03/26/22) I decided to meet. The place is beautiful, vom good service and that's all!

Anyone looking for a coffee shop is looking for something different. Nespresso many people drink at home or in the office.
There isn't even strained as an option. For those who understand extraction methods, you know that a carioca (which was offered) is different from a strained one in V60 or Chemex. The coffee strained in these methods I mentioned is cleaner, soft drink and with much more sweetness.

Well... I ended up ordering an Egg Maltine Frappuccino, a Belgian chocolate pie and a still water.
In this matter the service sinned. It looked like Casas Bahia, delivering orders all in installments. First the pie arrived, after about 5 min the water arrived and after 10 min the Frappuccino.

Now about the orders: (contains irony) the water was fantastic, mineral, cold and with ice and lemon in the glass. The pie, I thought it was a little sweet and firm, the presentation is pretty. And finally the Frappuccino.......ah the Frappuccino. Seriously.... I was outraged! R$16.00 for practically just whipped cream. I discarded 90% of what was handed to me. The amount of liquid was ridiculous, it seems that they extracted a standard 40ml espresso, put a little milk and the rest pure whipped cream. Just see the photos I'm posting. I removed 'almost all' whipped cream, because there was still a little leftover that sank into the glass. But you can see with the glass still full the amount of drink.

Total of R$46.00. There's a lot to improve!",0.034404761904761896,5,ChIJJWX0yWdXzpQRAoSJuBGp6gg,1,Positivo,521

Chest of Wonders - Maid caf√©,"Visiting the neighborhood of Liberdade is to discover different places and live unusual experiences. It was no different on the last 18.09.22 when, after visiting an ikebana exhibition, curiosity made me enter the Chest of Wonders.

It is a Maid Caf√©, a subcategory of cosplay caf√©s that appeared in Japan in 2001.

In a playful and delicate environment, where pastel colors predominate, the customer is received by attendants dressed as servants from the Victorian era who address him as 'master'. They say that they are actually kittens, and that only by magic that lasts for the time they stay in the establishment (1 hour), communication with humans is possible.

On the menu, predominate colored milk shakes, cakes, pies, coffees, teas. I had the red velvet cake (hmmmm‚Ä¶) with coffee. All very tasty.

Oh, and on the menu you can also choose the type of service you want to receive: delicate, aggressive, authoritarian, submissive... I preferred to be served normally, really!

It is a cafeteria that works in a very cute environment, but also very childish. I thought there was a children's party going on, at first sight kkkkkk But come on, let's get in the mood.

I ordered a cappuccino and a cheesecake. The food is delicious, but honestly, I don't think it's supposed to be the focus of the house. When you order the food, you also order the kind of treatment you want to receive. I ordered the funny/clunky one. I don't know if I was supposed to get into the role and scold the girl every time she messed up, but I couldn't. She apologized and I said 'it's okay, honey, everything's great' lol

In the end, I left feeling that it was a bit of a fetishized place. I, who have no inclination to boss others around or be bossed around, felt a little uncomfortable.",0.30375,1,ChIJUSpnAqr5zpQRcDtkw0UEYno,1,Positivo,614

Gateria Cat Cafe,"It has immense potential to be one of the most visited places in the city, it has drinks, teas and delicious food, all accompanied by very well cared for kittens that are up for adoption.
I visited on Saturday at 1:00 pm, an empty time where I stayed until 3:30 pm, and when I left there was already a considerable queue.
To visit the Jardim dos Gatos you need to book in advance, the times are every 30 minutes with a limit on the number of visitors at a time, and honestly I think it's worth paying (R$16.90), where part of the money goes to NGO maintain the costs, it is a beautiful space, the cats are well taken care of and most of the time playful, and it has toys for you to interact with them.
Even though I'm not vegan, I thought it would have more vegan options on the menu, but since it opened recently, I hope to have more options in the future.
The cat garden is totally separate from the restaurant area, the places are totally clean and don't share the same environment.

What we ask:
*Italian cappuccino (R$12.20) - it's a good option for those who like classic drinks, even more so with a cat design on top that makes it a pity to drink.
*Creamy Italian chocolate (R$14.90) - in my opinion it was the best decision, it is a very creamy drink with an incredible flavor, you can tell that the chocolate is of good quality.
*Pink lemonade (R$14.90) - I didn't particularly like it, the drink is very acidic and doesn't go well with food.

*Quiches with Salad + tomato and basil (R$26.50) - I highly recommend it, the quiche is wonderful and the salad is very well served.
*Las 3 Marias (R$33.90) - A well-balanced meal, easy to please anyone.
*Cuca de Banana (14.20) - The best possible vegan option, it's what I feel most like going back to the place to eat.",0.32788617886178856,2,ChIJ1frS2L5ZzpQRYTC8j56RdGQ,1,Positivo,747

the cafe is very tasty, with several tables and super helpful and polite attendants. we tasted a very tasty '3 leches' cake, as well as an incredible cinnamon roll, certainly one of the best I've tasted in the city. in the case of the house cinnamon roll, I noticed that the syrup comes with nuts. particularly, it's not my thing, but it's purely a matter of personal taste and nothing that discredits this delight. ask, seriously! the espresso is well-brewed and delicious, too.

Saint Decor Bistr√¥,"TIP: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME GOING TO THIS PLACE!

Very nice decoration of the place, but due to the prohibitions it ends up not being a cozy place.

About the menu:
Plenty of options for both breakfast and lunch.
The hours leave something to be desired, they serve lunch until 4pm and coffee from 4pm to 7pm and on Sundays they only have the lunch option. From what I understand, they made an exception in serving us coffee (as long as it was the simplest) and a crepe.
The crepe is very tasty, thin crust and just the right amount of filling. I was a little upset as I removed a piece of HAIR from my plate. I took it out quickly and threw it on the floor, I didn't approach any of the employees, I looked at the rest of the crepe to see if there was anything left and I continued eating. But I didn't feel confident anymore and it kind of 'failed the ride'.
The coffee was served in the cup with splashes (apparently from the machine itself, ok), but in general in other places this is not usually the case.

It would be a more cozy place if the customer had the option of freely choosing the menu, regardless of the time of day.

I found it strange and bizarre not to be able to take pictures in the place, but we respected it and inside we only photographed the dishes, which was very frustrating!
The waiter was very respectful when approaching asking us not to take pictures because they were sale items (I even asked if the place was about to close, which would make sense to sell the decor, but he said no).

We decided to leave the place, without tasting everything we had intended, since we understand that coffee on Sundays was an exception. To mark the moment and the visit, we decided to take pictures on the public sidewalk, taking advantage of the beauty of the front of the store.
A kind young man even closed the door for the photos to be more beautiful, although we were not comfortable being on the street.
A lady, maybe the same one mentioned in the comments that I hadn't read before going to the place, opened the door and made comments about being able to take pictures and not book, but as we are not doing any book, much less carrying photographic equipment I just I smiled and continued shooting.

I don't intend to return to the place because I don't feel welcomed and because the hours are 'strange' and incompatible with my routines.
But it would have everything to be a nice place to go.
A feather!

Obs. I had given 2 stars because the CREPE WITH dark hair (since my daughter and I are redheads) was tasty. However, after reading the distortions of information from the 'responsible', I thought it prudent to reduce to ZERO stars, too bad we only have the option of 1.",0.12489108409321173,1,ChIJnwdJsFVYzpQRp3yJhTvySAY,1,Positivo,795

I made a comment on Instagram and got blocked. LOL.
I wasn't going to comment anything here on Google, but I saw that many people spoke about the lack of tact of the Owner of the place.
And that!

In response to what you comment in your answer below:
I was disappointed with what happened and I'm not ashamed to say what happened, truthfully.
I went into the Bistro, upset, I wasn't having a good day, I had left the house with nothing to wear, I was returning from the doctor and I just wanted to go into a nice place, order a coffee and work.
I asked to use the bathroom and internet, the waiter pointed me to the bathroom and said they didn't have internet. I used the bathroom and unfortunately I had an intestinal disorder, but I took all the precautions, I put the toilet paper face down, (inside the wastebasket), I flushed and made sure that the toilet was clean, I looked in the bathroom for a disinfectant or a little sniff to soften the odor (there wasn't any) and I went to wash my hands (I still thought I'm going to throw liquid soap in the toilet, but I didn't have any), I went to the men's bathroom and washed my hands. I sat down at the table (a little embarrassed) ordered a coffee and a croissant, but I couldn't take too long, because I was working and what wasn't my surprise when the owner of the place asked to sit next to me and told me more or less like this: 'you must use the bathroom and flush it quickly, you left a horrible smell in the bathroom, the lady who cleans it is not here today and I had to clean it, I put all my lunch outside, I had to use a lot of disinfectant to the smell goes away, imagine if there were people near the door, you shouldn't even use the subway bathroom like that and......a few other things'
I was horrified and still felt guilty for not being well. I paid my bill and said, the place is beautiful, but I won't come back here anymore, I thought it was a lack of respect and sensitivity in how you treated me.
You need to have more empathy with others.
I'm sorry if the odor was strong and believe me I didn't want to go through that.

For sure go if you want that instagramable moment- that‚Äôs really the point of this place. BUT if you don‚Äôt care to wait in line for an average dessert (and I‚Äôd say subpar coffee), I‚Äôd stay away.

The food was delicious, we even ate more of the risotto.
Spot's decor is beautiful and you can tell from the entrance that every little bit of care was taken into account. Service was great too!

Quanti Cafeh,"I came to see the work of barista Andy, who won first place at the KOAR Cup yesterday, to try the coffee blend that was champion in the competition (I highly recommend it).

I was surprised by the space, Quanti Cafeh opened a little while ago, it is still finishing adjustments to the structure, even though it is already open. It's really cool to see the 'birth' of this company with a different 'footprint'. And the owners are present, solicitous and willing to resolve criticisms and accept suggestions.

It has the promise of being a 'sensory caf√©' and in fact everything contributes to a unique experience: ambient music with quiet MPB, cozy chairs, VAST amount of books to accompany your coffee and the option to sit on a sofa, either alone or to read a story to the children.

As for drinks, it has several experiences, hot, cold, drinks, based on espresso, milk, filtered, strained, etc. And BEAUTIFUL baristas!

The environment is also PET FRIENDLY and you can bring your dog!

Quanti Cafeh offers vegetarian and vegan meals and drinks, very well seasoned, perfect cooking, tasty and homemade food! They are prepared in an open kitchen, where it is possible to follow the preparation of the dishes and see a small garden of fresh spices on the counter, used in the dishes.

All organic waste is reused in composters that feed the vegetable gardens on the counter. Coffee grounds are also recycled through a partnership with Recoffee Design, which transforms them into durable products such as decorative objects and biojewelry (some of these products are for sale in a discreet shop next to the kitchen).

The most different drink I saw was an Ora Pro Nobis Lager, but it has several drink options, including natural ones.

The dishes are √† la carte, the lunch option is unique (a main course option that comes with the salad of the day) and does not follow a defined menu (they are still studying one), so get ready to be surprised by the dish of the day! Because they are always different dishes, values ‚Äã‚Äãmay vary depending on the ingredients of the day.

Today I had a vegetarian lasagna, with eggplant, zucchini, cheese and tomato. It came with two salads: coleslaw and hummus. Very good dish for one person. For dessert, I had a semisweet chocolate ganache tart with strawberry sauce. Everything on point and well seasoned. Finally came the cappuccino very well garnished in the latte (I chose the vegetable one) and very tasty.

The owners reported that they are still finalizing the adaptation for small children (the high chair arrives in a week, the changing table in the bathroom in a month), but the space already has a cozy sofa to stay with them.

The environment has comfortable tables and chairs of different capacities (couples, groups), sofa and also the counter.

SUPER RECOMMEND TO KNOW!!!

The prices are also above average and I didn't really like the cappuccino or bread with catupiry.

They are fun, they play with the kids who go crazy when they arrive, they bring the family to party with the little ones, they take pictures, anyway... too top!

When we started to eat the cake, there was a hair. The attendant apologized, removed the plate, and did not charge. But the experience was very bad, because what I ate made me sick to the point of vomiting due to the nausea of ‚Äã‚Äãdirty food with hair.

I leave this comment so that other users do not go through this. But mainly so that the business owner understands that when the customer goes to the establishment he wants to live a good, pleasant and relaxing experience. Despite not having been charged for the cake, I drank the drink on the pulse already wanting to leave. One suggestion would be to offer the customer a new menu item as an apology, so that he can enjoy something good in the midst of disappointment.
There was another episode where the bread was moldy, and it was the same thing, the attendant removed the plate, she didn't bring another one to replace it, but she didn't charge either. But I was disappointed.

Le Pain Quotidien,"a 2 stars review is as insulting as ‚Äòbonitinho por√©m ordin√°rio‚Äô.  let me elaborate better:
I love LPQ. it‚Äôs useless to think that all LPQ around the world can serve the same food: of course they are different: LPQ buenos aires serves unimpressive & nondescriptive  food. LPQ NY it‚Äôs very good, but not as good as LPQ washington, which is nevertheless just a shadow of the gorgeous LPQ le sablons in bruxelles. of course we are talking about bites & sweet treats, not haute cuisine; overpriced bites, a constant all over the world.
LPQ sao paulo began his history very badly with the pinheiros restaurant. then they opened in lots of shopping malls. the menu itself is interesting & offers the same good tartines they serve all over the world.  a very, very good salmon & avocado tartare. the sweet treats are less consistent but there‚Äôs a good pistachio tart. anyway the pastry in general is lackluster and sometimes not that fresh...
unfortunately, the shopping higienopolis restaurant is so shabby you could say it‚Äôs plainly run down. too bad becs it has a great garden. it‚Äôs a very charming old house which has a splendid little balcony on an internal patio, they do not open at all... the place is not that clean, the waiters lack basic training.
the worst: the food one day is good, the other is lame. they simply cannot keep the same standard of quality from one day to the other. it‚Äôs almost a roulette russe: you never know if the food is going to shoot or not... one day their hibiscus tea is great, the other is stale.  the mousse de chocolat can be so good you just cannot stop thinking when you can go back and have another one, then it becomes so tasteless & badly prepared you have to give it back to the waiter. coffee is an abomination: a matter of taste, but what is not subjective is that having coffee in a cup broken & dirty is plainly revolting.
the problem with this restaurant, since I‚Äôve been in other LPQ in SP with no problems whatsoever, is there is no effective menagement here, nor the employees are effectively trained.
when you‚Äôre having your food at 9:15 pm (the restaurant closes at 10:00 pm) & the cleaning staff is already sweeping the floor around you, the only thing you can do is finish quickly, so the cloud of dust does not enter your mouth, leave & have coffee & dessert in the nearby mall.

Le Pain Quotidien,"Originated in Belgium, this international chain seems to maintain a good quality standard worldwide, offering a sort of refuge in several big cities ‚Äî it being no different with their cozy Higien√≥polis unit, doubling as restaurant/caf√©/bakery, that occupies a beautiful high ceilinged, antique house right next to the shopping center, with a nice outdoor seating area (nicer if it weren‚Äôt for the noise of traffic coming from the avenue).
Foccusing on fresh ingredients and organic produce, it""s a most welcome option for a healthier, lighter meal that is both generous in size and rather flavourful ‚Äî rich salads and delicious panini options, among my favorites.

I was with my wife, my triplets and my parents when we sat at a table in this creperie to order a crepe when my babies started crying wanting their bottles. I asked one of the attendants to pour some water into the creperie sink because the bottle had excess water. One of the attendants, the 'superior attendant', stated that she could not answer my request because it was only for use in the Shopping Mall! I was at the creperie inside the Shopping kkk' I felt like an indigent. Without understanding the posture of this attendant I replied, thank you! Then the same attendant was staring at me with a mocking look, expressing anger. I was very embarrassed and angry because no one is treated like that. I saw a comment here on Google reviews by a customer that said the following about the aforementioned Creperie: they were very attentive to me and my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwho was thirsty and they gave him a disposable glass of water, I thought it was simply AMAZING'
And with my 11-month-old children who were crying because they wanted to drink milk from a bottle??????????? I love animals, but children come first, don't they? I, as a Tutelary Counselor, see rape of the vulnerable, abandonment of the incapable, beatings, etc., and treating my children like this is unacceptable! Does this attendant have children? Is this attendant a good mother? Does she, as part of a society, value defending the rights of children and adolescents as stated in Law 8069, ART 4? Sad to be treated by such a person! In the end, my wife bought a sweet crepe but I lost my will because of this employee's neglect! Lack of empathy, lack of humanity, lack of professionalism! What world is this?

The Drink is wonderful, the food is good, there is a lot of it and the waiters are very polite people.

In my opinion: they could open the door to make people more comfortable to enter.
Increase the options on the menu and change the lights to make it look more cozy since the proposal is not to be a street bar, but a more individualized space.

McDonald's,I ordered a smoky BLTQPC meal. After waiting in line for some while I received my mail it was improperly prepared.  It was missing most of the ingredients it was missing the bacon two slices of tomato and the sauce.  when they re-made the sandwich they had three old pieces of tomato on it horrible have a bacon strip when it should be more and on top of that as if that wasn‚Äôt the worst they actually put mayonnaise on my sandwich that does not require mayonnaise. I was so disgusted I did not go back inside to confront them with this issue this is our own going problem with this place I suggest that no one go here or at best if you must check your entire order before you leave town they redo it. The strange thing is when I bought it first back to have it made properly the gentleman at the window had no idea what it said on their own receipt for what the order was in and insisted on constantly asking me what I ordered when it clearly employee said it on the special receipt that is attached to the sandwich box.  It sounds like there‚Äôs some more training that needs to be done for their employees.,0.06770186335403726,2,ChIJWz3R7e_3zpQRv3DnEFLTS9E,1,Positivo,1309

It""s hard to expect to find what you find when you walk through the hallway to enter the place. It""s very cool looking, industrial-ish with an open kitchen.

You order by scanning a QR code which identifies your table and takes you to a site in which you place your orders (very helpful, with dish descriptions and pictures). Payment must still be made by going to the counter, but I assume this will change in the future.

They have breakfast/brunch items, as well as more lunch-like dishes, which I didn""t look at. I thought the food was very good, cooked and seasoned nicely. The avocado was especially tasty. Their coffee is also to my liking, strong.

Service is made efficient and laid-back by their online system, without the usual overbearing service you might find in Brazil.

Kopenhagen,"Completely disappointed with the service from the guy at the cashier.
This guy lacks management or training!
Today, January 9th, I had a bad experience at Kopenhagen do Village.
I could never imagine that there, in that mall, I would find such a mocking, ironic and responsive employee!
I asked if there wasn't a manager and he went to call him himself, something I doubt he did or if he did, his absence, the store is sorely missed!
We left without speaking to the manager, who didn't come down.
The boy, without patience, threw the cat's tongue and left without even putting it in a bag, such was the employee's slight!
Of all the Kopenhagens I've been to, this was the first time I received this kind of treatment!
Perhaps the boy needs a vacation or some good training!
That unit, I'm not coming back!
Even because in the Village, there are several other cafes!",-0.0030164930555555414,4,ChIJXYKxua9YzpQRG1WyE33QAsk,-1,Negativo,1471
Kopenhagen,"TRAUMATIZING SERVICE!
I'm never coming back! I waited a while with my father, who is already a gentleman because he loves Kopenhagen, we would buy chocolates and have coffee, after getting a table I went to an attendant at the salon, very polite as well as the guy at the cashier and asked about the possibility of putting one of the white chocolates that we would buy at the bottom of the cappuccino, the ‚Äúbarista‚Äù started screaming in her lungs, being extremely rude and impolite saying ‚Äúnot here, I will not make anything out of the recipe, here you can‚Äôt, nothing out of the recipe ‚Äù, I understand that you can't, but the way she spoke was extremely aggressive and cordial not only with me (client) but with her co-workers as well.

The only point that could be improved would be the variety of flavors, it didn't have as many varieties as I thought it would, some flavors were repeated like the Belgian chocolate in 3 versions, the pistachio one was missing, which I think is indispensable.",0.346,4,ChIJUfXALND3zpQRq1PODPZ_J04,1,Positivo,1520

Fran's caf√©,"Bad experience!
I had to flag one star in order to comment, but the correct rating would be ""minus star"".
When we arrived, today, at the place and went to a recently vacated table, with 4 chairs (the table seats 4), a gentleman - who later we would come to know is Luiz, the owner - abruptly and even rudely , crossed in front of us, without even asking us how many we were in, and removed one of the chairs, taking it to a table at the side. As we were waiting for my husband, my son went to another table, with an unoccupied chair, and asked if it could be given to us, to which they cordially replied yes. When my son removed the chair, Luiz intervened and asked: 'but how many are you in?' With my son's answer, that there were 3 of us, Luiz said out loud: 'here we don't have a chair for a bag!' My husband arrived, and I said that we would leave, as I would not have breakfast in that place. By the way, I won't go back to that Frans Caf√© unit even if it's the last place on earth to have a coffee. I have never witnessed such rude treatment in a trade. And the owner! I repeat: the table seats four and he had removed one of the chairs without asking us. Therefore, if there was a chair left at the next table, it didn't matter if it was occupied by a purse. It is obvious that if a chair was missing or if someone arrived and needed a seat, it would be readily offered. There was no justification for being rude to me and my son, out loud and in front of everyone. Before leaving the place, I went to the cashier and asked the name of the gentleman, and at first glance I was ignored by the woman who was there, but when asked again, she replied: 'it's Luiz and he's my husband'. I said: 'He is a terrible customer service person!' Luiz, who had disappeared through the door, came back and told me: 'you must be stressed for another reason'. No, Luiz, I wasn't stressed. I'm on vacation in S√£o Paulo, and when I come to the capital - and I come to S√£o Paulo a lot - I always go to Ofner, at Shopping Ibirapuera, where I've always been very well attended and where everything is divine, from the environment to the products, excellence, even the attendants. But suppose you are really stressed and want a coffee break, Frans Caf√©, owned by Luiz and his wife, in Shopping Morumbi, is not the advisable place to look.

I am an airport user and whenever I can I have coffee in one of their stores, which is very good.
But here goes my complaint and warning:
Your service system is horrible
After paying at the cashier, where there is an organized queue, there is a fight to get what you bought.
It's every man for himself. Those who don't play or speak loudly are not answered or stay last. This stresses the employee and especially the customer who leaves with a bad experience
Please think of a system or procedure or practice to improve this. Use examples from other networks.

Well married: very dry pasta
Malted chocolate cake: the best ever, the dough seemed the freshest, but nothing special, it doesn't have the characteristic taste of good chocolate.
Conclusion: not worth the amount paid, the cakes seemed to have been in the fridge for days (1 week cake in the minino) and then they were dry.

Padoca of Man√≠,"I wasn""t expecting the tasting menu from Man√≠ (obviously) but I definitely expected more from one of Helena Rizzo""s restaurants. I know that Padoca is the more casual of the three restaurants with more accessable pricing and dining experience, but at the very least I would think the dishes would be well seasoned and delicious. We ordered the mini polvilho with the house made coalhada (sour cream). The alternative choice was an industrialized requeij√£o, a surprise they would even serve an industrialized cheese like that, but their sour cream was very good. We also had the Rosbife de filet mignon which came with a warm potato salad and lettuce with what was supposed to be a dijon dressing. The filet mignon was dry and chewy. The potato salad was better the next day, we brought the leftovers home and added sea salt and butter which brought out the flavor of the herbs. We did ask for salt at the restaurant but they only had iodized table salt in little paper packets. The soup of the day was pretty good. It was a creamy potato leek soup with their house bread. Tasted like it had homemade chicken broth and the bread seemed to be naturally fermented and was covered in seeds. We brought home a slice of gluten-free chocolate hazelnut cake that was moist and surprisingly good after the meal we had.
The service was good, and the space is cute and on trend, although it""s a very small space inside and even though there""s a lot of interesting added value products to buy like the Man√≠ olive oil and some good looking coffees and ghee, we couldn""t even shop because all the products are on shelves in the hallway entrance and standing there to look at products blocks the flow of people entering and exiting the restaurant.
I think we will try again for breakfast-I really want to love the food.",0.2380277777777778,5,ChIJEVNSJt5QzpQRJq6_T_O3u1s,1,Positivo,1782

Upon receiving the attendant left our order and left without leaving the sugar and napkins. We had to get up and go get it.
Products: A 15 cm slice of bread on the plate R$ 12 ??? Absurd!! It's not worth it!!

The Coffee Moema,"The Coffee

Pros:
+Simple environment with little decoration where you place your order on a tablet with a very simple and intuitive interface on the sidewalk.
+I went on a holiday eve after dinner, I didn't face a queue, it was a very quick and smooth process.
+There are few drinks, but the ones they have are very tasty, I particularly loved the house matcha Latte.
+The service is fast.

Neutral:
-The place has a very simple proposal, so there is very little space for you to support your order or even sit down, the most likely thing is that you have a drink or eat standing up right on the sidewalk, especially if the place is full.
-Although the service is fast, it owes a little in terms of friendliness, but nothing that becomes a problem.
-Considering the region, the price is quite 'okay'.

Cons:
-Unluckily or not, the app itself on the tablet owed a little, nothing too serious to the point of delaying too much, but it was a little slow and even crashed, needing to reopen it.
-Croassans, cookies, etc... They are not reheated, they come at the temperature that is there in the window.

Would I go back again? If I worked in the region, I would definitely go there twice a month to have something, everything I tried was very tasty, but as I don't work in the region, the answer is 'very unlikely'.

Final considerations: Although I have raised a lot of cons and neutral points, the place fulfills its proposal well, which is to be a 'coffee station', it has its flaws, but they did not become an absurd problem for me, apart from the fact that the drinks are pretty fancy.",0.04020027281746032,5,ChIJ_RW-xpRbzpQRoYO8SeQkN8Y,1,Positivo,1868

Pros:
+Comfortable environment with a simple, cool and very objective look. We went on a Friday night close to closing time, we easily got a table.
+Excellent service, everyone is very friendly there.
+The place has a wide variety of cakes and other sweets, in the morning the place serves brunches that seem to be delicious.
+I tried 2 cakes (one chocolate with strawberry and the other with Nutella filling), all magnificent, very fluffy and well filled. I also had a delicious strawberry, banana and Assai smoothie, all very delicious.

Neutral:
-Considering the quality of the dishes and other sweets in the area, the price is right on the line between 'okay' and expensive.

Cons:
-I don't have any negative points yet to highlight, the experience was very nice.

Would I go back again? Yes definitely. I would love to try other sweets and even the savory ones that the atelier has to offer.",0.2875595238095238,5,ChIJxwOpcrBXzpQRXiWqf4Sigtw,1,Positivo,1936

We had the tuna salad which we didn‚Äôt consider a salad but was ok, would not order this again. The breads are good quality with yeast flavor. The p√£o de queijo is heavy which means a lot of cheese. Too cheesy for me but I would recommend if you really like cheesy bread. The juices were good, one of our garrafas came broken and we didn‚Äôt notice until we finished the juice :( they should be more careful about this. Gin and tonic was good quality.

Padoca do Brique,"I am a happy resident of the Brooklin neighborhood in Sao Paulo and was delighted to find this charming little bakery close by to my apartment. As an American, it can be hard to find a big hearty breakfast in Brazil like those I am accustomed to back home. However, Officina offers the most complete breakfast I have had in Sao Paulo - and at a surprisingly fair price. Most importantly, they have BACON - the bacon that us Americans enjoy so much!

They also offer other various breakfast combinations to satisfy you depending on your level of hunger, which are delicious and very affordable as well. The other great things about this place is their coffee offerings - plenty of creations all served with a nice presentation.

Additionally, they have a very nice lunch offering and the bakery has fresh bread and treats everyday (the carrot cake with the chocolate is a personal favorite).

I now go once a month or so to enjoy a nice breakfast outside on their open patio - a lovely spot to start your Saturday or Sunday.

The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because they charge extra for butter, extra jam, and other condiments. Brazil needs to learn that these things should be FREE.",0.26778508771929826,5,ChIJxd1brrVbzpQRyGBNe4zeyo0,1,Positivo,1942

This latest, we were first there, ordered the brunch and then had to chase multiple times for service (ie as others were served).  When the brunch arrived (in parts, through chasing), it evolved that they‚Äôd delivered an item from another table by accident, which I‚Äôd started.

When presented the bill they charged not only the brunch but charged the item, their own mistake (a nice but unwanted item,
given a ‚Äúbrunch‚Äù is already plenty).

Pros:
+Comfortable, simple, rustic atmosphere. I went on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't crowded, we managed to get a seat easily.
+Excellent service, everyone was very friendly, they served us quickly.
+I had the pleasure of enjoying some desserts on site such as cookies, lemon pie, cakes. Everything was very tasty, the lemon tart in particular was what enchanted me the most, I found the texture of the dough very good, very soft. As a drink, I tried juice and Italian soda with green apple and another one with red fruits (this second one I didn't like so much, but the one with green apple is very tasty)

I also had breakfast there where the natural juice was delicious and the grilled baguette with cream cheese, although tasty, seemed to save on the cream cheese (just a detail). There, we can buy grains to make at home. I'd say it's a great core coffee shop (for coffee seekers), but the brunch x value options didn't make me opt for brunch.

Pros:
+Place with an absurdly nostalgic appearance and sound that represents my grandmother's old house, it is a simple, small and comfortable place with many vintage decorations.
+Despite the place being small, I easily found a vacant table.
+The place has a wide variety of dishes that include cakes of different flavors, brownies, cookies, savory pies, snacks, etc...
+I had the pleasure of trying some cakes there, some are 'good' others are great. For example, the brigadeiro cake is well stuffed, not too sweet, very moist, I liked it a lot, curiously I found it quite nostalgic and extremely tasty, mainly because of the filling that reminds me a little of my grandmother's chocolate cake, while the chocolate cake white chocolate with strawberry was much sweeter, with a more intense sweetness, which I confess I didn't like as much as the brigadeiro, but my wife loved it.
+Considering the region, the quality and quantity of the products, I thought the price was very good.
+Service was absurdly fast.

First he ignored us when we spoke the first time, then he said several times that it was ours, 'it could only be ours'.

He didn't even try to find out when we commented that he wasn't even the color and size of our hair. And despite not having charged for the ice cream, in addition to being rude, he didn't even apologize, a 'I'm sorry', nothing, we left looking like we were acting in bad faith. We didn't charge him and I was going to pay anyway, but the hair-eating situation was bad and the customer service managed to be even worse.

HUB Food Art Lounge,"HUB Food Art Lounge is a restaurant within the Hotel Pullman in the toney Vila Ol√≠mpia district of S√£o Paulo. HUB has gotten great reviews and, as I had tickets to a concert across the street in the Theatro NET SP, I decided to try it.
The chef sent out an amuse-bouche, a bolinho de bacalhau (codfish ball), just a bite but quite good coming from this connoisseur of bolinhos de bacalhau. They also provided a couvert of delicious warm fresh baked breads with various spreads. I chose the ceviche of the day as my appetizer. The portion was very generous, almost big enough for an entr√©e. My entr√©e was the house specialty: octopus (polvo) cooked in a special oven called a ‚ÄúJosper‚Äù. This oven both cooks the selected item, be it seafood or meat, and finishes it off with a barbecue type exterior. This dish was extraordinary and, at my request, the chef very kindly agreed to show me the Josper oven.
Service by my waiter, Muhammad, was impeccable. By the way, as someone who enjoys the standard caipirinha with lim√£o (lime) and cacha√ßa, the barman at HUB makes an excellent drink. Highly recommended!",0.41296918767507007,5,ChIJJ45OI2hXzpQRXJl5Lij_BSw,1,Positivo,2094

But since I‚Äôve been to all those places so I decided to try their signature dishes from a la cart menu. The menu is not big but the food is delicious and surprisingly really affordable.

I was trying to reserve but it was booked out for the next four months. In the end I was able to get a walk in table at 5pm without waiting. The hostess said the best time for walk in is between 5pm and 6:30pm on weekdays. Other time would have to wait for at least 2hrs because their tasting menu is 1.5 hrs.

Evvai Restaurant,"Very mixed feelings. I have visited a long list of Michelin star restaurants and I am quite familiar with the standards required to gain and maintain stars. I believe if a Michelin guide critic experienced my visit the star would have been put into question. I will start with the negative.

The music is very questionable, the interior decor gives a warm and cosy ambience but they were playing heavy rock and other loud, heavy beat tracks which ruined the ambience and left me very unsettled as a diner and I found it difficult to focus on the conversation. On top of that the speaker behind us had a poor connection so it was producing a distressing interference/ high pitch sounds. We raised this with the waiter and asked if they could turn it down or disconnect the speaker but they did not despite multiple reminders, they could have moved our seat when the restaurant was emptier but they did not.

We asked for non-alcoholic cocktails at the entrance as we saw some really creative cocktail options. The waiter questioned us in shock, ‚Äúno alcohol?‚Äù and proceeded to question us at to our reasons, this was quite alarming and unprofessional. When we were seated upstairs we saw other drinks arriving, we had to remind them of our drinks order which was 2 different drinks of their creation, when the drink eventually arrived it was 2 of the same drink and not different drinks. We were essentially served straight juice with a bit of lemon. Despite asking for no ice, the drink returned with ice twice and the third time a diluted version where the ice had clearly just been removed and the drink not remade.

There were repeated instances of poor attention to detail and a general lack of attentiveness from the staff. Multiple of the tasting menu courses arrived without the adequate cutlery already placed. Multiple requests for ignored such as requests for salt and pepper, which arrived almost halfway through the meal despite asking at the start and multiple reminders being given. Requests for bread were also late. The food was churned out quickly but the rest of the service was very slow and poor.

The food was generally good. The tuna served on ciabatta was delicious, as was the black cod. Whilst the food was consistently well presented the flavours did not always live up to the presentation or the Michelin standard one would expect. For example, the lamb chop was seasoned to perfection but there was no meat on the chop and the little meat present was extremely chewy and gristly. I mentioned it to the waiter who brought another and it was delicious, tender and succulent; this should have been served in the first place.

The sourdough bread is freshly made in the restaurant. The desserts were also good. They give you a goodie bag on the way out which contains cookies.

Unfortunately the service and standards were so poor and the majority of dishes average in taste that I‚Äôve given the restaurant 2 stars.",0.045057035876001385,5,ChIJKdgB3tJZzpQRPavAu0IR--E,1,Positivo,2110

The oysters come from thier own special bed, and were delicious and briney, though a bit pricy, even by American standards.  The fish dish I got was excellent.

Had them raw, but they have many preparations.  The Smoked Black Anchovy Carpacio was also amazing.  The Moqueca that I wanted was served to two, but the waiter let me know they could for one.  Served in a clay pot , the tomato based fish stew was outstanding.  The fish, mussels, octopus and shrimp were all cooked perfectly.  Something that is not easy to do and most often one or all come overcooked.  This was not.  The tomato broth had a hint of a smoky flavor that was delicious.

"Camarada Camar√£o Shopping Cidade S√£o Paulo: Camar√µes, Peixes, Happy Hour, Restaurante, S√£o Paulo SP","Camarada is a chain restaurant that features many shrimp style dishes. Being that it""s Sunday and the restaurant is near Ave Paulista, there were droves of people in the mall it is located in as well as the restaurant being packed. I was expecting a disaster of a long wait and a messed up order. Our waiter Ricardo made it look like we were his only customers. He got the order correct even with the language barrier, and we were eating within 30 minutes. Sadly, I felt the food was not up to my standards as most chain restaurants tend to be, and the price was a little high. It was incredibly loud in a packed restaurant open to the mall on one side. I did learn something curious while I was there. For years, I used  TripAdvisor as a restaurant guide as its review structure and rating system were accurate to real life. This, however, has changed due to an interesting practice I observed in the restaurant. Ricardo brought me a tablet open to TripAdvisor and asked me to rate and review the restaurant along with the bill. I noticed that this location was rated the second best restaurant in Sao paulo out of 14000. I am her to tell you this restaurant is not in the top 500 nevemind the top ten. TripAdvisor better get their ducks in a row as they appear completely unreliable. Anyway Camarada is likely among the top 5 restaurants in the mall and worth a look if you need a meal prior to seeing a movie in the cinema across the hall.",0.18138888888888888,3,ChIJ9-VhjVxYzpQRVOBQt5ohttw,1,Positivo,2196

All for a fair price, with spectacular service and a family atmosphere (if possible, try to go on weekdays, for dinner, when the mall is less crowded). In short, value for money is worth it!

For starters, the pastries (extremely crunchy, sun-dried meat and coalho cheese with cream cheese) are very tasty and worth ordering. Also noteworthy are the poop lemonades with passion fruit and berry. As a main course, the Siciliano (present on the Due menu) is very tasty, both for the good breaded shrimp, the main stars of the dish, and for the brie, apricot, leek and almond risotto. For vegetarians, Quinoa Primavera was also highly approved.

Finally, the desserts deserve a paragraph just for them, after all they were sensational. And here's a tip. Ask for the typical sweets. The bolo de rolo, heritage of Pernambuco, the state where the Camarada Camar√£o chain was born, is one of the best I've ever tasted. Balanced, with the perfect layers and unique flavor. Still comes with ice cream and guava syrup. The cocada baked in the oven, in turn, is not far behind. Quite the opposite! It was perfect, creamy, sweet in the right measure and goes very well with the passion fruit sauce and the ice cream.",0.2940939153439153,5,ChIJ9-VhjVxYzpQRVOBQt5ohttw,1,Positivo,2200

Great proposal for specialty with shrimps.
Good drinks and other drinks.
Wide menu with fair prices and very similar to the direct competitor.

It achieved my 5 star rating, but one point to be improved is the service, especially with the waitresses.

I'm not sexist. On the contrary, I've always employed more women than men, but in other segments (finance, controlling, sales and call center). But there's a segment where, if the waitresses aren't very well trained, they always fail in the details.
They don't pass your table proactively. You will always have to call them.
They don't keep serving you the drink you ordered (in my case, sparkling wine)
I know other restaurants of similar and higher standard and I judge it by what they deliver.

Food wasn""t great, especially for the price. My wifes seared tuna was still fridge cold in the middle. Some of my grilled veggies had been cremated. Everything was under seasoned.

While the servers were pleasant, they lacked a basic concept of service; constantly leaning over us, not acknowledging our requests (how are we meant to know if you heard us?), not replacing the cutlery we ate our seafood starter with, to eat my steak main (even when we asked)  Slamming my beer down on the table, and not making a substitution when the restaurant had ran out of an element of a dish (salad isn""t the same as fries. If they ran out of the ""special"" fries for the steak tartare then they ought to switch them for one of the many other types of fries they sell, instead of making me purchase a whole portion additionally)

When I told the waitress I""d like to remove the service charge she abrasively asked me why. I told her that I wasn""t happy with the service and expected better, she put my receipt on the table without saying a word (no thank you or goodbye, let alone an apology) and walked off.

I've never tried such a delicious macaron, really!

The store is cute, all delicate and with a very cute decoration ü•∞.

The macarons are in the window, with their respective flavor names.
And the flavors‚Ä¶they are incredible!
It's surprising how they manage to bring an incomparable flavor to the sweet and everything is very balanced.
For example, I bought a caramelized banana üçå macaron. I felt the taste of banana and her caramelized. I thought it was great how they managed to bring 2 flavors in a single candy!

In the store üè¨ you can buy gift boxes.

Macarons cost 6.50 each.

There is a very large variety of flavors üòã.

The store doesn't just sell macarons, they also sell honey bread üçØ, madeleines, coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and a few other sweet treats.

But it's also worth going to the store, it's beautiful and the service is super attentive.

There are tables for coffee and hot chocolate, but although here on Maps it is stated that they are already serving them in person, this is not true.

By the way, limit of 3 people in the store due to COVID-19, I thought it was great.

Caf√© Paris,"After eating family-style French food in France, I learned that there are definitely two types of French food. One is characterized by heavy sauces and lots of drama, the other light, flavorful and distinct flavors. Hearing about this French restaurant, I had to check it out. As soon as the appetizer arrived, I realized that this was non-fussy, home style and wonderful French food. With the first bite of the entr√©e, I recognized three distinct flavors and I knew that I‚Äôd found my favorite French food. Service was awesome, food was wonderful and the ambience reminiscent of sidewalk French caf√©s.

I bought 3 Crepes and a large portion of potatoes. I bought it to eat at home. I came home to surprise.

Terrible! I paid dearly for all of this, I didn't receive the right products I paid for and they still got a crepe for them, and the ones I took home were in conditions impossible to eat. Congratulations to those involved! Worst place I have the misfortune to visit and I will never go back! I didn't even go back to complain, because it's far from where I live and it wouldn't be worth it, at most an apology and then pick up other muggles that you buy there. Because I doubt they would return my money back! I think this is the first time I rate a place with one star, but if I could, it doesn't even deserve 1 star, you ruined my night, and one person was left without the crepe, because there were three, one for each, and you gave it to me only two, I had to give mine to my daughter and I tried to eat your disgusting potion that the little I ate gave me heartburn!

Dengo Iguatemi Campinas,"Best chocolate in Iguatemi Campinas at the moment ‚Äî and possibly the finest coffee, too!
Intent on being 100% Brazilian, they creatively blend cocoa (coming from the Cabruca, in Bahia) to native fruits like cupua√ßu, cumaru and jabuticaba, but also with cacha√ßa or bij√∫ (an indigenous very fine cassava flatbread). Their version of gianduia comes with castanha do Par√° instead of hazelnut. Results are out of the ordinary, surprisingly tasteful and harmonious.
Staff seemed knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the products and their origin, and very obliging in offering a sample of nearly everything that was there in the shop ‚Äî like the original Mel de Cacau (cocoa juice), or the subtle Cocoa tea (technically an infusion, since there are no tea leaves in its composition).
Coffee coming from either S√£o Paulo or Minas Gerais states was delicious and far from the artificial flavors of other brands found in the mall. Both tea and coffee were freshly prepared and beautifully presented in ceramics.

Ra√≠zes Nordestinas - Culin√°ria T√≠pica,"'Ra√≠zes nordestinas' is an indisputably affectionate restaurant: the service is kind, the place has a thematic decor without putting too much emphasis on its elements, the ambient music is low and favors going with family, friends or a partner to chat.

The menu is limited, but fulfills the proposal of having typical dishes.

üòåüçóüçõ I tried the lasagna (R$39) and my husband tried the free-range chicken with pumpkin (R$39). The chicken was delicious, although I found the quantity small. I didn't leave the restaurant hungry, but I confess that I expected a larger piece of lasagna and that the chicken would come with a larger amount of rice and string beans (side dishes).

In summary: I recommend the place, as the food is good, as well as ordering an appetizer and being prepared to order dessert as well. It's worth it, and with the full meal you'll leave happy and satisfied.",0.10852130325814538,1,ChIJQRFkjOVazpQRQKj2RHBhb9k,1,Positivo,3123

These people are outstanding!
We came here the first time soon after we saw it opening. They have a tatami area and a normal seating area (do I need to say where my daughter wants to dine???)
It was also our last restaurant before going in quarantine... And our last few delicious caipirinhas.
Yesterday we ordered take-away out of 'saudades' and we were happy like a child on Christmas Eve! We found some nice personal touches in our bag.
Their service has always been personal and outstanding, and in times they need to differentiate even more, they sure know how to live up to the new expectations!
How lucky to have such a pearl just behind our street corner.

Kome (Moema),"I booked the restaurant through the Fork, there was a promotion of 30% and I wrote that I wanted a table in the tatami section. We arrived on time and were greeted at the door, but our table was just a normal table in the middle of the restaurant, so, they don""t read their reservations. I saw there was a tatami table free but thought it should be reserved before us, but no: A couple entered after us, asked for that table and seated there. thanks. They didn""t even ask were we wanted to sit! The place we sat in was very dark and I noticed that half the lights in the restaurant were off. (???) Trying to save energy ?! It would be romantic if there were some candles but no. The staff was nice, the watermelon juice was incredible, but the mojito was horrible. We asked for the premium rod√≠zio and sushi came. It was very nice, the fish was fresh, but the not very creative for something that is premium I don""t think it was as expected... Sorry, had much better, you should really try to be more creative. The 'best' were the ones with truffle oil, duck magret, quail egg and scallop, like trying to be very chic but the inspiration is just french restaurant? And they even brought us more of the truffle and quail egg almost raw without us asking (I hate truffle and my boyfriend hates raw egg, ) I was like, okayyy... Could have told us before making it? It was an extra from the chef but I just wanted some sashimi so they brought slices as big as beef, one finger thick, one finger wide, could not fit my mouth... God, we were waiting for them to see we didn""t want any more and just take the rest away... And that""s when we were ignored for half an hour and they started to close the restaurant. We called the one that was close, which I think was the manager, and asked if we could have the rest of the degustation, we wanted the hot dishes. He asked us what was missing and was surprised we had nothing hot yet. He was very nice, told us it would take a minute and very fast we had the shimeji and seafood hot dishes... It was reheated sorry I noticed that...  It was not crisp and succulent like it should be, it was like dried rubber. The shimeji were not shimeji either, looked like small oyster mushrooms. The taste was good, but obviously was not made for us. Then it was half past eight and they had everything closed and the other clients were gone ( not forgotten, just us maybe) so we asked for the bill and asked if we had everything that was in the menu but the waiter told us... 'Aaahhh... You had the best ones.' I was horrified. We paid and run away from there... The staff was very nice but the service was one of the worst I have ever had. God, I swear, if you live or travel here in S√£o Paulo, don""t expect to be very well treated as a client in almost all commercial facilities in this city! And be very careful all the time. I was almost crying it was our two year anniversary and it was supposed to be special. Well, now I can write a informative review for you. I really hate to be mistreated in restaurants because I am a cook, so I am extra critic, if you want good sushi just go there, but don""t let them forget you!

Papa Tudo Sandu√≠ches,"Unfortunately I didn't have a good experience at Papa Tudo Sandu√≠ches. I had already heard about the establishment, as some friends used to eat there and I met a person who worked there. But I had never had the opportunity to eat at Papa Tudo Sandu√≠ches. On 12/06/22 at 10:48 pm I went to the Pay Less pharmacy which is next to this place and decided to try the sandwich. I went to the cashier and ordered a sandwich to go. The girl at the register took the order and I was waiting. In the meantime, I put a drop of the pink sauce in my hand in order to try it. I thought it was delicious, so I asked the girl at the cashier (a white and skinny girl) if there was any sauce in the sandwich and she sharply and without paying me much attention said no üòï. I found the way she spoke strange, since she didn't even ask me which sauce. But that's okay, what can you do? Again I asked her if any sauce was put on the sandwich and she said no. So I asked: to eat some of the sauce do I have to eat it here? She said yes. So I said: I'll eat here then. But my husband said that we had to take the sandwich, as our little dog was feeling sick in the car. So I went to the girl at the cashier and said that I couldn't eat there and I asked her if after they made my sandwich I could open the package and put a little bit of the sauce and she sternly told me: no. He didn't even look at me. My God, I couldn't believe this treatment of me. The sandwich I ordered cost 33.00 reais, which was a little sauce? The cashier girl could even have said no, but without harshness. Meanwhile, some people in the place were eating a sandwich, putting almost a whole thing in the sauce. It didn't cost anything to be kind. Anyway, I believe that the girl who served me was not the owner of the establishment, because I believe that the owner of the establishment would not do such rudeness. It didn't make sense to me that I couldn't open my sandwich wrapper and put some of the sauce on it. Did the lady think I was going to dump the whole thing on the sandwich? Or did she want to sell me some drippings of sauce? Anyway, I didn't buy the sandwich, because I wanted to put some sauce on it and the girl at the cashier said I couldn't ü§î. Since I wasn't going to get into a fight with her, I left. But I'm making this complaint because I think that good service and education is the differential in a company that values ‚Äã‚Äãits customers.

Their all-you-can-eat service is fairly priced for the amount of food you get, I went with my mother and we both left feeling as if our stomachs were going to burst.  I particularly enjoyed their onion rings and and special fries with 4 cheese sauce. My mother really liked their hamburguer with caramelized mushrooms. We also ordered the drinks refills wich had plenty of options and a petit gateau (lava cake) milk shake that was to die for. The only downside was the small waiting line to be served but they had a great system and we didn""t have to wait long to be seated, just get there early and you should be fine. I also do wish their buns were toasted but I guess because they make so many tiny burguers it would be impractical to have warm buns, but that""s just my nitpicking.

However, I also have to mention the fact that not giving 5 stars would be the hefty price. As much as the prices of things are all inflated, I believe that the value of the Kilo could be a little more into account, considering and comparing with other restaurants in the region and considering the place where the restaurant is located.
Only downside is the price which could be adjusted.

Lanchonete Conquista,"Super recommend for a hearty and tasty lunch üòâüòé

In my opinion it is one of the best value for money restaurants in the region. As it is an upscale neighborhood, many restaurants are quite expensive, but the prices here are consistent with the dishes in other regions (comparison made with a restaurant in the interior shopping center - O Tropeiro in the Bebedouro shopping center).

The dish I ordered was the commercial chicken fillet and a lot of food came. I ate in peace (I was well satisfied). For those who don't eat much, this dish easily serves 2 people. The food is extremely tasty.

It's a great place to go during the service's lunch hour (they don't take long to serve the dish), go with friends, for happy hour or a casual lunch.

Regarding the service, it was a normal service (in terms of friendliness and attentiveness), nothing to complain or praise. However, it is worth mentioning that the service is fast and objective.",0.15303030303030304,5,ChIJadWy0X_3zpQR1JndmyJ7R8k,1,Positivo,3545

This restaurant is relatively new in the area. It has been completely renovated and has become a very pleasant environment.
It does not offer self service, only dishes from the menu. But don't be fooled, it is certainly much cheaper than any self service in the region. They offer dishes of the day or grilled with salad or side dishes. All are excellent.
Another very good point is the speed. They are very quick to bring orders. Super fair food, very well made, with a homemade touch.

Saracura Gastrobar,"Saracura gastrobar has been on my bucket list for a while. Today we finally managed to go there. A Sunday lunch. The restaurant is fantastic, we were very well received by Lucas who soon showed us that the menu and the order are 100% digital. We ordered a portion of 9 rib drumsticks which were magnificent. Very dry, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Came with a very good pepper! We ordered the vegetarian dish of mandioquinha puree, mushrooms and salad with figs and arugula, it was delicious. And the rib dish with kale and corn meal, the rib melts in your mouth, perfect seasoning. I also ordered a berry lemonade juice. Overall the dishes are innovative and delicious. The price is very fair, even more affordable than other restaurants on 13 de Maio. If you're on 13, go to Saracura and check it out, you won't regret it.",0.45614583333333336,5,ChIJae-yBIzFsY4Rr8U0LYwm1HE,1,Positivo,3715

Very practical and easy. Bathroom is clean and has a very nice toilet area. The dishes are wonderful and diverse, cold beer and a very special service. I particularly like snacks, like the fries that come with sauce and ketchup and the Original beer. I recommend that everyone passing through the region come and enjoy the delicious dishes and the cold beer or draft beer. I liked the place, great environment to spend the afternoon with friends.

Saracura Gastrobar,"An excellent new option in Bixiga to escape the pasta-pizza scheme that obviously dominates the neighborhood where Italian immigrants settled in the early 20th century. Good food for a fair price and good drinks. The pork in the can has ribs cooked slowly and very loosely with cabbage and sweet grape tomatoes that works incredibly well. The house has excellent snacks, such as the chicken tulip, and good options for drinks too, especially the gin and tonic with cranberry juice and hibiscus tea. The Paulist√¢nia lager draft beer is very good. Just don't argue with them about the ""couscous"" that is the mainstay of another dish. It is an angu (creamy polenta) well seasoned and very tasty, but it is not couscous. They say it is, but that's ok, what matters is that Saracura is here to stay.

From the reservation experience I thought the service would be terrible, but it wasn't. The waiters were polite and attentive and the orders didn't take long to arrive. The crazy meat snack is good but lacked a bit of flavor. The chazin drink is very tasty.
Finally, I ordered the breaded corn fritter with cornflakes and cream cheese filling and that was my biggest mistake of the night.

Ortiz P√£o Molhado,"I was at Mercado Novo Saturday night and ordered Ortiz's Loin sandwich with guacamole for the first time.

Like most establishments on the market, we were able to view the kitchen and everything was very clean, however I had the impression that it lacks organization. There are two cooks to prepare the various orders, and only one was responsible for assembling the sandwiches. Our order took more than 10 minutes, which was the time established by the person in charge at the counter. I noticed that orders are often taken out of order to optimize assembly time...

The price of the sandwiches is fixed (20 reais) and I think that, due to the size, the price is high.
My sandwich was very tasty and appetizing, but I didn't taste the guacamole... just the mustard. If I had ordered a mustard sandwich, I would have really enjoyed it.

The place is charming and is in line with the laid-back proposal of Mercado Novo.

Restaurante Japon√™s - MAKOTO SAN Ë™†„Åï„Çì,"A true culinary gem in Sao Paulo, Makoto-san serves one of the most unique omakase dinners and certainly the best Japanese meal in the city, perhaps in all of Brazil. The ingredients used are simply not found in other Japanese restaurants in the area, and the innovative way in which the chef prepares and combines the various elements is absolutely artistic, creating original and memorable flavors.

My wife and I have traveled around the world, including highly-rated sushi restaurants in Japan, Australia, San Francisco, NY, Singapore, and other centers of cuisine, and experience at Makoto-san was so wonderful in our first visit that we immediately booked a return within 2 weeks. This is not something we typically do as we like to use our limited time during our travels to visit a wide variety of places.

If you are a local resident looking for an authentic and truly world-class Japanese dining experience, or if you are visiting from out of town and are looking for a memorable meal, do yourself a favor and book a dinner at Makoto-san (which is handled over WhatsApp). Be sure to not confuse this with a few other establishments also named ""Makoto"" in the city. You will not be disappointed.

For us, this will be permanently on our list of restaurants to visit as long as we keep returning to Sao Paulo in the years to come.",0.17281746031746031,5,ChIJS4XuOgpazpQR84vpvrjCwkM,1,Positivo,3896

The places¬¥ decoration is very simple looking as if a house was decorated so serve as a small diner, which gives it the special atmosphere that is completed by the extreme energy and attention from your host, the sushi man, Makoto himself.

The kitchen is open and you see everything being prepared.

Nonna Lilla,"Bistro Nonna Lilla is a lovely place.
I found out through a social network referral, I followed and soon fell in love.
My first contact was a box, the wonderful breads, everything very fresh, and what a care with every detail. You're even looking for a gift, you'll love it.
We went to see the space and I loved everything, the decoration, the service, the space, the food, the drinks, the dessert all very incredible.
The space is not that big, but it is extremely cozy. The space between the tables allows you to have privacy, and you can move around smoothly. If you have any kind of mobility restriction, you can rest assured that the space will accommodate you.
Let's get to the dishes, how delicious, what a presentation, what a flavor, what a whim, what care. You can see that the boss does everything with a lot of love. We opted for the chef's recommendation, and it was an excellent choice. The dishes are extremely tasty, just right. There were other amazing options on the menu. Dessert is an explosion of flavors.
Everything was really amazing, I loved every minute of it.
The staff are simply very attentive, helpful, a perfect fit for the place.
Highly recommend, would definitely come back.
And if you go by car, we didn't have any trouble finding a parking space, even on the weekend and with a school nearby and a little party going on.
The price is affordable, and is compatible with all this wonderful experience.",0.41295314900153607,5,ChIJI12-U5dZzpQRuqM30-9sYCM,1,Positivo,3983

Joaquim Portucale Bistr√¥ Portugu√™s,"üëâüèª We found out that this is the first Portuguese bistro in SP. We went to meet and tasted some Portuguese delicacies such as alheira (which I love), codfish cake, dishes with cod pieces and also with it in chips or shredded. All simply sensational. Desserts are also part of the menu, such as the Bel√©m and Santa Clara pastries, as well as the Piriquita pillow.

üëâüèª The atmosphere is delicious and the service is great. And to make it even better, they have a super novelty for the Cup: in addition to the games being broadcast on the bistro's TVs, the customer will still have options for several portions and snacks from pubs and the Original beer will be sold for 13 reais! Simply unmissable!

Unlike common Sao Paulo italian restaurants' commonplace, and for the best experience, Pasta dishes are matched to the sauce as intended by the recipe, instead of the ""free-to-mashup"" of all varieties of pasta to any kind of sauce that only warrants inconsistent experiences.
All said, it was a great experience for a place that is not renowned and alone in an area full of bars and pubs but not nice restaurants per se.

The House,"Simple, down to earth, and pleasant little breakfast spot.

Positive notes:  Prices are lower than market average, biscuits and gravy have a homemade taste, their bacon is VERY GOOD. I think I know where it's sourced from, and this stuff is thick, good marbling in it's fat (yes, bacon), and good natural flavor. Country fried steak is average. All menu items are cooked to order. The kitchen is open to guests for a more homey feel.  Owner's are very friendly and take time to make conversations with new and regular guests.

Neutral notes:  This is a Christian restaurant. They are open about their religious values but do not come across as pushy or force any sort of agenda or fellowship on you.  I enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant, and I do not have religious leanings. I have seen multiple regulars sit together at the same table adding to a very communal feeling.

Areas of Opportunity notes: Service is not super fast. It's a small place, but more tes than not, the person taking your order is also likely to be your cook, runner, server, busses, and cashier.  I don't recommend coming if you are in a hurry. Soft drink service is inconsistent. I have eaten here about six times and soda has been flat and crisp. I suspect they're using a soda system connected to smaller CO2 tanks.

Overall, I think this is a great hidden gem. Food quality is stronger than Blueberry Hill or Pancake Cabana. Service is not quick, and it feels like a small operation. However, prices are good, environment is very friendly, and they genuinely aim to make you feel at home.",0.15628367003367,5,ChIJ7fy-Ah4ZyZQR0nwyT1z5_W4,1,Positivo,4037

It's sad... a place where before it was delicious and the service was great, my father used to say it was a little piece of Italy and it turned into that.

First for the great service we had from the beginning. The place is super nice. And the pizza was delicious. Very tasty indeed. You can tell the quality by the appearance and the care that was prepared. We ordered a pizza with two flavors. When paying, they charged separate amounts of half a pizza for each. Sensational! The single price of the most expensive pizza is usually charged.
And to improve they don't charge the 10%. There are places where the service is horrible and you pay without choice. Here I would gladly pay, but they don't charge. Without a doubt I will be back again.",0.19553571428571426,5,ChIJ6QfZ1UxRzpQRUPUEfN6cc80,1,Positivo,4055

The pizzas were very good on the carvery. Thin crust, small pieces and little filling, perfect because you can try them all. However, the service left a little to be desired. It took a while to start the service and some flavors took a long time to come out even asking more than once.

New York Lounge - NYL,"I had been to the house a few times before the pandemic and I went back there yesterday with my boyfriend. We had a pretty bad experience. The service was terrible from the women at the entrance to the security guards around the place. The girls at the reception are rude and without any patience with those who arrive. The audience has changed a lot, making the place not so welcoming anymore. Most of the environments were very dirty and/or deteriorated (the entrance to one of the lanes had a screwed-up door and broken glass bottles, which stayed there all night). The music outside was low with repetitions and the Djs left something to be desired. The place no longer holds that many people and it is very tight to walk or dance, being clear that there were more people than allowed. Not to mention the long queues to pay (and we left a little early, so I don't think we got the longest queue of the night). And as if it couldn't get any worse, they overcharged our order at the end of the night.",-0.10950680272108844,5,ChIJIQdQJatZzpQR4cZPIILajHs,-1,Negativo,4072

New York Lounge - NYL,"Update

Strengths

Adhesion of the wristbands facilitated the service (however, a friend who was older did not fit on his arm, he was dissatisfied);
Change in security personnel made the environment more pleasant and humane;
By a cashier in the outside lane it improved a lot;
The 3 tracks (funk, electronic and pop) improved in choosing which environment to stay;

Negative points

A very full house, they need to respect the capacity, as this greatly reduces the attendance, not counting the locomotion in the space that is not feasible;
They should ban the use of electronic cigarettes on the subway track due to the size of the environment, which is much smaller compared to the others (in my case it is difficult because of my asthma, depending on the essence it is impossible to enjoy the role);
Organizing queues to get in and out still need to improve.
The cashier outside could be open before 4am if it is full on the day;

Would it be too much to ask to ask for pixta subway on Friday too?

Fontana - Botafogo - RJ,"The Culinare is a great Italian restaurant in Botafogo with a special concept the Brazilians call Rodiz√≠o, a pizza roundabout so to speak, via which ‚Äì instead of ordering from the menu ‚Äì the friendly waiters serve a different pizza on a plate every some minutes and stop at every table, asking you, if you want one or more of the slices on the plates from which you choose the slices you like. It‚Äôs an all you can eat pizza concept for a fixed price.

So for little more than 30 Real you choose from a huge variety ranging from salty pizza to sweet pizza. Yeah you got me right, Brazilians love sweet pizza, just as they love the salty one.

I got myself slices of pizza with all kinds of toppings ranging from different cheeses, calabrese to chicken, and then the sweet pizzas rolled in.

And there I got a slice of chocolate pizza, one with smarties, little M&M as they call it here, and those with sweet cream combination. What should I say more.

From Rio with Love!

Wonderful house. Excelent reception. Fantastic Pizzas

I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates REAL pizza with the right ingredients.

Very tasty pizza, less waiting time than I expected, I will buy many more times, the stuffed edge is magnificent.

Did you know that the capital of S√£o Paulo is the second city that consumes the most pizza in the world, second only to New York? That's right! Brazil produces something around 1 million pizzas a day and more than half are consumed in S√£o Paulo alone.

For those who enjoy truly Neapolitan-style pizza, this is perhaps the best place in town to satisfy your appetite. Although in the early days the individual disks soon after being served began to rubber, this problem has been completely resolved.

Pizza was born much earlier because it is a derivative of flat bread prepared by the ancient Greeks and Egyptians and it was already a popular snack when the tomato arrived in Italy brought by the Spanish rulers of Naples, in the 16th century. Today it is prepared with a multitude of ingredients.
