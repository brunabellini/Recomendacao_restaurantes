Rissotos with less flavor, sandwiches that don't have onions that taste like onions due to the lack of cleaning of the knives and dishes with less quantity or quality."
ChIJq_4ke2hXzpQRvXoMlkd1PLs,Banana Caf√©,4.625,0.4204342012154512,1,Positivo,"There‚Äôs a huge variety of seating available from inside to outside but whenever you sit the views are amazing!

In terms of atmosphere, I would say that it is an informal and pleasant place for small groups, as unfortunately the wooden benches are extremely uncomfortable."
